To learn about the exact cost of your software, book your free consultation, and our experienced software consultant will guide you and provide the proper estimate for your project.\n\nHow much time will it take to develop software from scratch?\n\nCustom software development from scratch, on average, takes from 4 to 12 months. The overall development time largely depends on the type, size, and complexity of the software solution needed. Connect with us to get the right timeline estimate for your software project.\n\nHow will you secure my software project information?\n\nOne of the most important measures we take to secure your software project information is signing NDAs, which guarantees that our team will do their best to protect it. In addition to signing an NDA, we apply network security measures and conduct regular virus scans to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.\n\nDo you provide documentation once the software is developed?\n\nOnce the software is developed, we provide software requirement specifications (SRS). The main goal of our SRS is to provide guidelines about what the software will do and how it will be expected to perform. It outlines your project\u2019s purpose, features, and functionalities needed to fulfill your needs.\n\nWho owns the right to the software code?\n\nAs it is your software project, you will get full ownership of your source code. We sign a legal agreement that states that source code is your intellectual property, which we hand over to you after software deployment. We ensure that you own the final version of the source code, and we do not owe any rights to your source code once it is deployed.\n\nWhat if there is a change during the development phase?\n\nAs it is your idea and your project, we cater to any of your change requests. You just need to specify the changes you want to your allocated project manager. Before executing any changes, we will conduct meetings to get your approval and ensure that project development goes in the right direction.\n\nHow will you update me on the project\u2019s progress during the software development cycle?\n\nYour feedback is important to us as it helps us achieve the expected outcome. So, to ensure that you are involved in the project, we assign a project manager who will be your single point of contact. We set up weekly/monthly meetings to discuss the project\u2019s progress and the upcoming milestones. Basecamp, Microsoft Teams, Skype, Slack, Zendesk, ClickUp, Notion, and Jira are some tools we use for client communications.\n\nDo you provide maintenance support post-project deployment?\n\nYes, we provide 3 months of maintenance support for your software project. Although we perform all the tests before deploying any solution, errors and loopholes can arise once the project goes live. To ensure your project works smoothly, we track the interactions and resolve errors as they emerge. During the maintenance period, you can contact us anytime for any help.\n\nCan you provide a brief description of your hiring models?\n\nYes, we provide three hiring models: full-time, part-time, and hourly. The full-time model boasts full-time developer availability (160 hours/month) and is suitable for enterprise and mid-size projects. Meanwhile, the part-time and hourly hiring models are ideal for start-ups and mid-size projects. Part-time models offer 80 hours/month of developer availability, while for hourly models developer availability depends on the client\u2019s availability.\n\nHow is Space-O different from other custom software app development companies?\n\nSpace-O is a leading custom software development company in Canada, with experience serving 100+ clients and Fortune 500 companies representing various industries.

Glass Packaging.\n\nGlass is a material unlike any other, capable of creating stunning, memorable experiences, and it\u2019s the most sustainable packaging material on earth. At O-I, we have a history of transforming how the world stores food and beverages \u2013 of making glass more accessible to more customers and consumers. We reimagine how glass is made and sold by innovating production techniques, pioneering recycling and sustainable technology, and unleashing the iconic, brand-building potential of this packaging that is the kindest material for the planet and its people.\n\nRead Our Story\nNews and Stories\nAdvancing Glass Recycling Through Groundbreaking Programs and Partnerships in 2024\nDECEMBER 18, 2024\nKentucky Glass Recycling Gets a Green Boost: Ale-8-One and O-I Lead the Charge\nDECEMBER 10, 2024\nIn Quest to Produce the Most Sustainable Bottled Water, Beika Turns to O-I for Packaging\nDECEMBER 3, 2024\nDesign Book 3: Creative Reality - Innovative Solutions to Packaging Concepts\nOCTOBER 3, 2024\nOUR VISION\nShaping the Future Through Glass\n\nWe create iconic, healthy glass packaging so synonymous with brands, you recognize those brands by their packaging alone, even without a label. We innovate packaging design to enable customers to meet their own ambitions, from connecting with consumers on an emotional level to creating a more sustainable future.\n\nOUR STORY\nDriven Through Innovation\n\nInnovation and transformation are in our DNA. O-I Glass was founded more than a century ago by a man whose glass bottle making machine was called the most significant invention in glass in 2000 years. Founder Michael J. Owens\u2019 motto was \u201cIt can be done.\u201d And we\u2019re doing it. We\u2019re reimaging what glass can do, making it the world\u2019s most versatile, charismatic and sustainable packaging material.\n\nOUR MISSION\nOur Sustainability Vision\n\nGlass is the ideal packaging material to support a low-waste, circular economy. But sustainability isn\u2019t just about what we make \u2013 it\u2019s also about how we make it. Sustainability is woven into everything we do, from transforming our glass-making technology and processes to our customer approach to how we engage our employees and support our communities.\n\n1\n2\n3\nPower of\nGlass Packaging\n\nGlass is pure, sustainable, and the kindest packaging material for the health of people and the planet. Glass has an element of magic to it. It is beautiful and iconic. It can turn into shapes. It plays with the senses. Glass is 100% recyclable and infinitely recyclable. It does not increase ocean pollution. Glass is virtually inert, which means it doesn\u2019t interact with the foods and beverages it holds.\n\nWe love glass and we aspire to create a healthier, more sustainable, and more exciting world through glass packaging.\n\nDiscover Benefits of Glass\nGuided by Our Values\n\nAt O-I, we deeply care about our people and our culture.

We have nine skylights, five of which open. The product quality is terrific, customer service exceptional and they met Vancouver\u2019s stringent energy efficiency guidelines. Highly recommend.\n\n\u2013 Heather H\n\nWe had a wonderful experience. Originally, we purchased our Columbia skylights through a dealer. When we realized we had likely not ordered the correct skylights for our application, we contacted Columbia directly. Thankfully, Judy sorted our order out to ensure we had the correct product and connected us to a great installer. From that point forward, we were \u201ctaken care of\u201d and now the skylights are installed. We are very pleased with the skylights, and can\u2019t say enough about the great service we received from both Columbia and the installer.\n\n\u2013 Lind\n\nExcellent service\u2026 worked with Columbia customer service department on a single one time order and was given the best service in a long time. I bought a double glazed aluminum frame skylight for my motor home that exceeded the original by many times. The original was like a blister pack, Columbia Skylights has an aluminum frame with pressure seals and a full aluminum case. As an engineer, I really appreciate the excellent design. The slight extra cost is well worth the additional money. I had a major failure of the original skylight that caused extensive damage. This skylight will outlast me. I did not get any special consideration for writing this review and normally would not take the time, but this company is worth the effort.\n\n\u2013 Robert L\n\nColumbia supplied all the skylights in our house including two that open with motors. The product is first class and their customer service is fantastic. We had an issue with one and they fixed it with a smile within two days. I highly recommend them.\n\n\u2013 Jo F\n\nBought an 8\u2019 x 8\u2019 three layer skylight and after installation the snow stayed on it, even when it is 22 degrees Celsius inside our home. A very good insulation factor and is well worth the little extra it cost up front. We also get a lot of comments on how nice it looks and how much light it provides. I would certainly use Columbia on our next home.\n\n\u2013 Clarence L\n\nA superlative company, with a phenomenal product, exemplary customer service and product satisfaction. Fantastic shopping experience and aftercare. Could not be happier!\n\n\u2013 Ros K\n\nJust want to say thank you to Gord for all of his help on the skylight.

We\u2019ve only been ordering from Kheops for about 6 months and you guys are the only big wholesaler/distributor that has a rep that actually comes to us. We met our rep today and had a great time, what a wonderful man. It was so nice to see products, some of which I hadn\u2019t even considered ordering until I saw up close. We learned a lot and if we weren\u2019t already impressed with our first few orders (which we were Emoticon wink), we sure are now! Thank you for being one of the few companies out there today that realizes the importance of a face to face relationship\u00bb\n\nJolene Meic, Juno Designs/Hell\u2019s Belles Bout. & Gift Shop, Alberta\n\n***\n\n\u00abI really like dealing with you and your company. It is worry free. All products are on display and continue to sell very well. As I am a new customer in the retail market, I will continue to order a variety of products and learn more about what is acquired by our market.\u00bb\n\nThanks!

Unicel Architectural Vision Control became the premier choice for ease of use and error proof operation. The results met the quality and schedule expected for a state of the art, fifty-eight bed critical care addition. Excellent documentation and rapid replies to questions provided confidence to the design and construction team that Unicel Architectural was a team player for excellence. Unicel Architectural Vision Control systems are unmatched and the primary product we trust for integrated louvers.\n\nDavid J. Peronnet\nNCARB, AIA (Principal / Project Architect, PF&A Design)\n\nAs a provider of clinical healthcare settings, I know how concerned our clients have been during the pandemic with time-consuming cleaning on window blind and shade applications. Front surface-only applications are easier to clean than front and glass surface-side applications shade products. This is why I have recommended use of integrated louver systems in desired sterile, semi-sterile, and even in specific non-sterile environments; it surpasses the clean and hygienic performance of traditional shades and blinds \u2013 plus, their strings and cords are often dangerous for many of the patients for which we design. Vision Control\u2019s integrated louvers eliminate the need for strings and they require no maintenance because they\u2019re behind glass. Through Vision Control, our clients\u2019 staff have far better control of safety, privacy, light, temperature, and sound for every patient, a goal for every Healthcare Architect.\n\nJay Pelton\nRA, LEED AP (Principal Sr Project Architect, Array Architects)\n\nAs a nurse working with critical ICU patients in Baltimore hospitals, the\u00a0Vision Control louvered glazing\u00a0makes my job much easier. The privacy it provides to patients in vulnerable times can make the world of a difference. The ease in use helps make it almost second nature to constantly use these during a shift. It is able to provide privacy, while still being functional for hospital staff to keep an eye on patients and their vital signs.\n\nVictoria Luc\nRegistered Nurse at Baltimore area hospital, MD\nNews and Updates\nThe latest from Unicel Architectural\nAll News\nProduct News\nArticles\nPress Releases\nLatest Instagram Feed\nFollow us on Instagram\nHow can we harness the power of AI to better our c\nUne vision plus claire pour un espace plus sain.

Places where you\u2019ll find yourself among the friendliest of unfamiliar faces, some of whom may become lifelong friends. Why not start your visit in one of our most popular places?\n\nExplore All Destinations\nGros Morne National Park\n \nSt. John's\n \nTerra Nova National Park\n \nTorngat Mountains National Park\n \nL'Anse aux Meadows National Historic Site\n \nFogo & Change Islands\nFlights Car & Ferry\nWho knew that arriving here could be such\u00a0a\u00a0departure?\nTravelling here by plane is a popular option, and airlines fly into St. John\u2019s, Gander, Deer Lake, Happy Valley-Goose Bay, and Wabush. Flying times for direct flights to St. John's are about 3.5 hours from Toronto, 6 hours from Edmonton / Calgary, and 5 hours from London. Other international routes are available into the region via Halifax. Regional airlines service smaller destinations and operate flights within the province.\n\nTravellers are encouraged to check with individual airlines and ferry services for the most up-to-date information prior to and during travel.\n\nMore Flight Information\n\n Planning on driving to the island? Most travellers will take the ferry from Nova Scotia to either Port aux Basques or Argentia, and there are ferry routes for travelling between the island and Labrador. You can also drive to Labrador from the mainland of Canada, via Qu\u00e9bec.\n\n\nMore Car & Ferry Information\n\nThings To Do\n\nThere\u2019s enough coastline wrapped around this place to stretch across Canada four times over. So whether you take a hike along ancient footpaths, pack a picnic and watch for whales, or head out to sea to hunt for icebergs, you\u2019ll find it all comes standard with a great ocean view.\n\nExplore All Things to Do\nIceberg Viewing\n \nWhale Watching\n \nHiking & Walking\n \nBirdwatching\n \nLiving Heritage\n \nFestivals & Events\nFind Yourself Here\nTravel Stories\nEvery trip you take leaves you with at least one story.

Squeegeeing the glass frequently, then drying with a soft cloth is highly recommended. Using a squeegee after each shower helps keep spots and scale from accumulating on glass components. We also follow the recommendation of the Bath Enclosure Manufacturing Association (BEMA). You should avoid abrasives, bleach, acidic or vinegar-based cleaners and scrubbing pads. Read labels on cleaning products thoroughly before using. If your glass is coated or treated with surface protectants, see the PDF below for instructions.\n\nDOWNLOAD PDF\n\nTEMPERED GLASS\nWATER PROTECTION\nALUMINUM, BRASS & STAINLESS STEEL\nPOWDER-COATED METAL\nWARRANTY\nCONTACT US\nCONTACT US\nCome visit our showroom to talk about your shower door and custom glass needs!

We are proud to be your leading supplier of any glass or shower door in Toronto.\n\nShower Doors\nVIEW \nGlass Railings\nVIEW \nCounter Shields\nVIEW \nTilable Shower Bases\nVIEW \nGlass Protection\nVIEW \nSeals & Hardware\nVIEW \nOur Upgrade Options\nTake Your Shower to the Next Level And Keep it in Pristine Condition For the Coming Years\nSTARPHIRE SUPER CLEAR LOW IRON GLASS\n\nMost glass, while clear, has a green or blue tint to it. The tint and clarity of a pane of glass are greatly affected by the sand used to create it, specifically, where the sand was cultivated and how much iron and phosphorus the sand contains. Starphire Super Clear Low Iron Glass is a high-quality glass product known for its superior clarity and transparency and is almost colourless thanks to its specialized manufacturing process, which removes the majority of iron from glass. Starphire Super Clear Low Iron Glass offers maximum visibility, allowing the true colours, aesthetics, and design of any interior space to be displayed to their full capacity.\n\nINVISIBLE SHIELD 15-YEAR GLASS PROTECTION\n\nAny glass surface has an imperfect surface that can attract a build-up of products, soap, dust, and other particles. The Invisible Shield 15-Year Glass Protection is a specially formulated protective coating that creates a strong, durable barrier that helps prevent chips, scratches, and other common forms of glass damage. Invisible Shield 15-Year Glass Protection is applied through a specialized process, resulting in a protective nano-scale coating that seals the surface of the glass without any visible seams. The system ensures that particles cannot bond to the glass, making it easier to clean and maintain without the need for any special or harsh cleaning solutions.\n\nFLEURCO SEKUR SHATTERPROOF PROTECTIVE FILM\n\nGlass, when broken, can pose a serious danger. Fleurco Sekur Shatterproof Protective Film is designed to prevent the glass from shattering on impact. A film made from a high-quality, strong polyester material is applied to the surface of the glass and will hold the glass together when broken. While the glass will break, it will not shatter and potentially cause damage or injury. In addition to added safety, Fleurco Sekur Shatterproof Protective Film helps ensure the durability and overall performance of glass with improved resistance to scratches, chips, and other damage.\n\nWe Have A Reputation For Excellence\nTake A Look At Some Of Our Reviews\nConsidering a renovation job and need a bit of advice or a few ideas?\nWE CAN HELP\nWhat Our Customers Are Saying\nIt was a pleasure working with Shower Door Canada.

So creative, so smart!\nRead more\nJon Umphreys\n2024-09-15\nWe had so much fun with Mathews glass etching class. It was an informative Yellowknife recycling history lesson and a hands-on workshop where you create your own unique keepsake. I highly recommend this workshop.\nRead more\nShazza Riaz\n2024-09-05\nAttending the glass etching workshop at Old Town Glassworks was a highlight of our trip! Matthew's passion for the environment and his contributions to the city of Yellowknife were truly inspiring. His storytelling skills were captivating, and hearing his journey while witnessing his creativity firsthand was the best part of the experience. The workshop was not just about glass etching\u2014it was about connecting with the community and learning about sustainability.\n\nI highly recommend booking this workshop and including it in your Yellowknife itinerary. It's a unique experience that blends art, storytelling, and environmental awareness.\nRead more\nLaura O.\n2024-09-02\nArt and function in recycled form. Started with wine bottles but reaching to glass jugs and liquor bottles. Take the glass class, where you get to stencil a creation of your own with as many stencils you can put on your item. Matthew, the mastermind behind the studio and store, is a wealth of knowledge about Yellowknife and the community and ecological survival of the area. He has incredible stories, some a little long but effectively dramatic. With the class you get one item i.e. soap pump, vase, glass, bowl etc included but I highly recommend doing a second item for $25. Super fun, super easy and he will guide you through everything! I think this deal is better than just buying a piece but his works offer a lot to choose from.\nAnd take a quick tour through the recycled bike parts and his bike repair shop.\nRead more\nDeb Chak\n2024-08-24\nGreat business! Great Owner!\n\u00a0\nSamantha butt\n2024-06-22\nDid the workshop today. Was amazing, so informative, fun afternoon. Got to choose a glass item or bring your own to decorate and sand blast. Recommend doing the workshop or even just stopping by the shop, wonderful items to choose from\nRead more\nTracy Albert\n2024-06-17\nWhat Matthew does with recycled materials is truly remarkable! I attended Old Town Glassworks with some work colleagues and had little hope that I would be able to achieve anything good, as I am terrible at anything that involves creativity. Matthew was patient, kind, and walked me through the activity with grace. I came away with a beautiful glass and a memory to treasure! If you\u2019re in the area, this is an activity not to be missed.

We've always encouraged our clients to ditch the builder-grade French doors in favour of an Ocean View patio door. Not only do they benefit from the energy savings, but they also open up the space with a view to the outside world.\"\n\nStephanie and Daniel Postorivo\nInterior Designers\n\n\"The first thing that was installed when we took possession of our home was an Ocean View patio door.

The diversity of experiences and interests of its individual members fosters a creative and experimental environment. Glen Williams Glass is open daily, and welcomes visitors to observe the glassblowing process and enquire about the various techniques and styles of its eight members.\n\nThe studio was founded in 1995 by Andrew Kuntz, Glass faculty member at Sheridan College, and Carol Nesbitt, Camilla Willings, Michelle Miller, Megan Kenny and Jennifer Tarrant; graduates of the program. The studio continues to maintain strong ties to the college. Many of the current members are graduates of Sheridan\u2019s Craft and Design program, and have also sought additional education through courses and workshops at the Studio at Corning Museum of Glass, Pilchuck Glass School, and at Fleming College\u2019s Haliburton School of the Arts. Works made by the artists are exhibited and collected both locally and internationally in public venues and private collections.\n\nIn addition to its function as a co-operative, Glen Williams Glass regularly welcomes non-members to the studio. Qualified glassblowers are able to rent the facilities, and each year the studio members award a Summer Scholarship Program to a Sheridan College student.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlen Williams Glass\n515 Main Street, Unit 2\nGlen Williams, ON L7G 3S9\n\nglenwilliamsglass@gmail.com\n905-873-4092\nContact us!!\n* Indicates required field\nName *\nFirst\nLast\nEmail *\nComment *\nSubmit\nProudly powered by Weebly"

With more than three decades in the research and development of equipment for geophysical exploration, GEM is also known for its service and support \u2013 featuring knowledgeable magnetics professionals and the industry-leading three-year warranty program.\n\nAdvanced Quantum Magnetometer Technologies\n\nQuantum magnetometers take advantage of the spin of subatomic particles (nuclei and unpaired valence electrons). Through a process of polarization, particles are caused to precess in the earth's ambient magnetic field. The resulting frequency of precession can be translated directly into magnetic field units. Quantum results are scalar (total field intensity) as opposed to vector (i.e. from fluxgate geophysical instruments or GEM's Suspended dIdD technology).\n\nGEM leads in developing advanced quantum magnetometer technologies, including the Overhauser, optically pumped Potassium (K-Mag) and Proton Precession magnetometers. The company is recognized as the successful commercial developer of both the Overhauser and Potassium magnetometer / gradiometer. Moreover, its Proton Precession magnetometer / gradiometer is the latest technology system in its class.\nHelping Professionals Meet their Application Needs\n\nQuantum magnetometers and gradiometers are widely applied due to their ease-of-use, low cost of surveying, and data quality. Applications include Airborne Mapping, Archaeology, Earthquake Prediction, Education and Research, Environmental and Engineering, Mineral and Oil Exploration, Observatories, Unexploded Ordnance Detection (UXO), Volcanology and others.\n\nOur Technologies\nVIEW ALL PRODUCTS\n\n\nAIRBORNE MAGNETOMETERS\n\nThe worldwide application of airborne magnetic and...\n\nRead More\nRequest Quote\nUAV MAGNETOMETERS\n\nUnmanned Airborne Vehicles are pilot-less aircraft that are flown on...\n\nRead More\nRequest Quote\nSTATIONARY MAGNETOMETERS\n\nOver the past twenty years, GEM has become a stand...\n\nRead More\nRequest Quote\nGROUND MAGNETOMETERS\n\nGround geophysics continues to play a key role in subsurface...\n\nRead More\nRequest Quote\nREQUEST A CALLBACK\n\nIf you would like to receive a callback from GEM Systems.\n\nName*\t\nPhone*\t\nEmail*\t\nComments\t\n\t\nSubscribe to newsletter\n\n\nPlease select the Circle and click the Submit button.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\t\nSubmit\n\n\nNEWS and EVENTS\nPDAC March 2 - 5, 2025\n2024 Holiday Office Hours\nAGU2024: Dec 9th to 12th, Washington D.C.\n\n\nView All\nREQUEST A QUOTE\nSelect your product\nOverhauser Mag - GSM 19\nProton Mag - GSM19T\nPotassium Mag - GSMP 35\nVLF EM - GSMV\nSystems - GSMP 35A(B)\nPotassium Mag - GSMP 35A\nBase Station Mag - GSM 19W\nLight Weight Mag - GSMP 35U\nAirbird - GSMP 35U(B)\nMonitoring Scalar Euromag - GSM 90\nMonitoring DIDD Vector Mag - GSM 90F5D\nSuperGrad - GSMP 20S3\nHome|About GEM|GEM Technologies|Applications|Quotations|Resource Library|News|Contact Us| Site Map\n\n\n\u00a92025 Gem Systems Advanced Magnetometers.

We are a locally owned and operated LLC serving Red Deer and Central Alberta since 2004. Gold and silver is our business and not a sideline. We buy almost anything made of, or containing, measurable quantities of gold and/or silver. Jaxville sells gold and silver only in pure form (99.5% or better) such as bullion bars and coins. We take great pride in offering courteous and knowledgeable service, as well as doing our best to meet our customers' needs. Whether you are considering selling some old unwanted jewellery or securing some gold or silver bullion, please call us today.\n\nHISTORY\n\nJaxville was established in 2004 as an actual bullion exchange open to the public.\u00a0 The shop was opened with the goal of placing as much specie (gold and silver bars and coins) as possible into the stronger hands of the community.\u00a0 This is being accomplished by being a local market maker for gold maple leaf coins specifically, as well as a wide range of other gold and silver bullion products pending availability.\u00a0 We are buying all forms of gold and silver.\n\nLearn More\n\t\nWHAT WE DO\n\nJaxville also recycles scrap gold, usually in the form of jewellery, through refining and processing. Recycled gold is offered to local goldsmiths and fabricators at spot prices. Turn your broken or unwanted jewellery into cash. We are paying 75% of spot gold value on all karat jewellery.\n\nLearn More\n\t\nJAXVILLE VIDEOS\n\nJack Fortin, President of Jaxville, speaks of the importance of holding precious metals and answers a few of Jaxville's most frequently asked questions.\n\n\t\nPhone: (403) 346 5266\n"

Jean-Pierre Dion et sa fille, Lucie, ont envie de faire de la peinture sur toile et s'inscrivent \u00e0 des cours chez Mme Ena Auguste. M. Dion d\u00e9cide alors d'ouvrir un petit commerce de mat\u00e9riel d'artiste situ\u00e9 au 2070, boulevard Masson, Les Saules. Ses premiers clients furent, bien s\u00fbr, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves de Mme Auguste.\n\n\u200b\n\nQuelque temps plus tard, Lucie rencontre Claude Soucy qui devient, par la suite, son conjoint. C'est alors que M. Dion donne l'opportunit\u00e9 \u00e0 Claude d'ouvrir son propre commerce de fabrication de toiles sur cadre en bois et de chevalets en bois.\n\nEn 1983, Claude d\u00e9cide enfin d'ouvrir son commerce, qu'il nomme Menuiserie Claude Enr. Il y fabrique du mat\u00e9riel d'artiste qu'il vend ensuite \u00e0 M. Dion pour son commerce de vente au d\u00e9tail. La demande \u00e9tant grandissante, il est forc\u00e9 de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager dans des locaux plus grands. Il choisit le 1320, boulevard Masson, o\u00f9 le chiffre d'affaires fera un bond significatif.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEn 1986, l'achalandage augmentant toujours, il est encore une fois forc\u00e9 \u00e0 un d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement. Il s'installe donc au 4031, rue de Musset \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re de l'ancienne Banque Nationale du boulevard Masson. M. Dion d\u00e9cide alors de vendre son commerce de mat\u00e9riel d'artiste et Claude Soucy s'en porte acqu\u00e9reur. Lucie et Julie travaillent ainsi avec Claude pour couvrir les heures d'ouverture du commerce.\n\n\nLucie quitte alors le travail pour donner naissance \u00e0 leur premier enfant, Jean-S\u00e9bastien. Pour remplacer Lucie, qui part alors en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, Claude engage Lucie Charpentier, alors \u00e9tudiante universitaire, pour travailler les fins de semaine.\n\n\nEn 1994, Menuiserie Claude devient Encadrement Claude Enr afin de mieux s'adapter \u00e0 la vocation du commerce.

The colour looked identical to the 35W halogens they replaced. The beam pattern is better than the halogens (more even light intensity on the ground). It looks like LEDs have caught up with the 50W and below halogens.\n\nThanks for the great lights and the Tim\u2019s card.\n\nME\n\n\u201cJust wanted to say that I love my new lights.

I am so happy I found your company two years ago. Your commitment to assisting practitioners, like myself, is unwavering. I would not be able to do what I do without your products. I work with individuals who have experienced emotional and physical trauma that results in physical symptoms such as PTSD and chronic pain. I am the practitioner one comes to when the pharmaceuticals no\u00a0longer mask the pain and allopathic medicine can\u2019t cut it out. Bioenergetic therapy is about gently initiating the frequencies the body requires to heal. I can provide this service to many individuals with the assistance of Ergopathics kits such as Hormones, Immune system, Emotions, Chronic Pain, and Neurotransmitters. Thank you Ergopathics for your products and compassionate business!\"\n\n\u2014\u2002Sloane Campbell\n\u2002\nTop Results\n\n\"Test vials are a significant part of my practice and I don\u2019t know what I would do without them to help me identify potential imbalances and find solutions. Using Ergopathic\u2019s test vials I have been able to uncover some astounding health discoveries that have changed clients\u2019 lives once the imbalances have subsequently been addressed.\"\n\n\u2014\u2002Terry Larder (Mrs) Dip.KA, AKFRP, ND, SN Director Classical Kinesiology Institute, UK\n\u2002\nBest In the Industry\n\nI\u2019ve been using Ergopathics test kits since 2007 and they are the most accurate and well made in the industry. I have never needed to replace them after all these years. I particularly use the adrenal kit, inflammation, deep brain and emotions. I find them very effective.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2002Lisa Chilvers\n\u2002\nOffering new products regularly!\n\nI have been very happy with the product in quality as well as options of different types of vials offered. \u00a0Ergopathics continues to offer new products and new testing ideas.\n\n\u2014\u2002Bradley Kuntz, DC\n\u2002\nGreat customer service!\n\nWhen I decided to create my own muscle testing course, the biggest stumbling block I foresaw was the creation of custom vial kits. Ergopathics customer service put me in touch with Heather [in customer service] and she was amazing. She walked me through the entire process, answered all my questions, set me up with the affiliate program, and made many helpful suggestions on what vials to include, etc. I am very happy with the service I received from the whole Ergopathics team.\n\n\u2014\u2002Brad Case, ND, DC\n\u2002\nBetter testing with the vials!\n\nIncorporating vials in\u00a0my practice\u00a0has helped me work faster and in a more precise fashion.\n\n\u2014\u2002Xiomhara Knapp, Xiowellness.com\nContact Us\n\n1-888-959-6728 / 1-613-701-0659 vials@ergopathics.com\n\nEnter your email to subscribe to our weekly newsletter!\n\nEmail address\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025, Ergopathics."

We feature the stained glass of owner Dorothy Ball and showcase the work of other Saskatchewan and Canadian Artists. We are always looking for unique work to display on consignment.\n\nThe HUT is on Highway 56 located in Lebret, one of the oldest settlements in Saskatchewan. We are open on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays from May to December including statutory holidays.\n\nThe beautiful Roman Catholic Church rests on the shores of Mission Lake surrounded by the hills of the Qu'Appelle Valley.\n\nDorothy Ball\n\nI began doing stained glass over 15 years ago in the mid 1990's. In 2004, my dream of having my own shop became a reality.\n\nYou will find me busy making new creations in the back of the store. It's a small area but I find room to teach classes on Thursday evenings.\n\nI enjoy working with people and it is a big thrill for me should you choose to purchase a piece of my work. Knowing that some of my work is traveling to another land is quite amazing to me.\n\nThe hummingbird, a regular visitor in the valley, has become my logo. I enjoy making various versions of this hard working marvel of nature. You can find it in my stepping stones, window hangings or just by itself.\n\nWhenever you drive through the valley, stop in and say hello and better yet, buy yourself a keepsake from Lebret. Whether you come from down the road, across Canada or from far away, I love to have you sign my Guest Book.\n\nWhether it's a stepping stone, a night light, an Angel, or a larger window hanging, I'm sure that we can find something you'd like. If not we can design something together.\n\nCommissions Welcome\n\nSite Links\nHome\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy & Cookie Usage\nSite Map\nFollow Us\n\nLegal Stuff\n\nCopyright 2025: Dorothy Ball\nAll Rights Reserved.\nThis file last modified April 29, 2021\n\nSite designed and maintained by Young at Art Studios - Web Services"

We are very (100%) pleased with the details and the quality of the doors. MD Doors customer service is excellent. Steve was very helpful in assisting me with door selections that match both the exterior and interior of the house. Steve also followed up to make sure that the doors were installed perfectly. After searching through many companies for high quality doors, service and price, MD Doors was my first choice.\nBev\nVaughan\nWe contracted with MD Doors to install a new front door at the end of November. They knew we wished to get the new door installed before the new year, and were able to book us in for December 29th. Mike and Eugene (hope I got their names right) installed the door and were fantastic - friendly, professional and very focused on making sure everything was installed perfectly. We got a door completely different from anything else in the neighbourhood, and it looks amazing - we received quotes from other companies but no others seemed to have a door that matched our garage so perfectly, plus were very reasonably priced. This door is fiberglass (higher R-value), with a European locking system. We are EXTREMELY pleased we went with MD Doors, and with our new door\nAnna\nVaughan\nChose an outstanding wrought iron door insert & side panels - this firm was very professional, honest and most of all delivered what they promised - installers we very precise and cleaned up too!\nFranca C\nWoodbridge\nSteve and Mark were very helpful and reasonable in recommending replacement doors and locks for my front entry. Their installers were very good, arrived on time and were flexible with timelines for installation. The doors are of high quality and arrived as estimated. Highly recommend and will use again.\nJason\nWoodbridge\nI wanted to maintain the character and age of my home in uptown Toronto. Finding an arched top front door is impossible unless you go custom. MD Doors was an amazing alternative to the other Toronto manufacturers. I brought my desired design to MD Doors and they were able to match it exactly -- they even provided me with drawings that showed my design photoshopped onto my house. The final product is awesome -- check out the pics. MD Doors uses a unique overlapping door closure system that provides for a really tight weather seal. They included choices of hardware as well as stain glass (or in my case leaded glass) options. I couldn't give them a 10/10 because there were significant delays beyond their initial installation timing. Despite the delay, I would still recommend MD Doors\nBB Sam\nToronto\nI live in a 120+ year Victorian house in Cabbagetown. I wanted to 'refresh' my exterior - and went with new brick work (Hunt Heritage Masonry ) and new black slate roof with copper dormer, flashing and gutters (M&R Roofing). However, my exterior front door had developed cracks - and was draughty . Finding a solid wood door and transom was not an easy task. After speaking to many local suppliers, I found a gorgeous door system at a reasonable cost. Steve at MD Doors was most helpful in proposing various options - and I selected a beautiful, pre-finished European solid 'ash' door - naturally finished with multi-lock system, with transom window above. Although they offered multiple glass options, I went with antiqued custom-made glass made into themopanes from Cascade Hand Cut Crystal Inc. MD Doors picked up and installed the two glass inserts into the door system before bringing it on-site. The installation crew was extremely professional, courteous and meticulous. Very diligent and great cleanup after the work was completed. Strongly recommend MD Doors for a great product and professional service. Howard from Old Toronto\nHoward Goshulak\nOld Toronto\nI had a hard time finding good quality front door inserts for a reasonable price. I say reasonable because even though they are more expensive than their competition, you can really see the quality in where the joins of the frame are. It feels like their insert are built better and will last longer. We went into the showroom and they were very friendly with us.\nDaniel\nVaughan\nFound MD Doors at a booth at the Home Show and paid a visit to their storefront a couple of weeks later. Very helpful in helping us decide on style of door and great pricing! After installation we had a minor issue with the door frame and gave them a call. They immediately came out to take a look after we got off the phone with them. They came all the way from Concord to Oakville within an hour and corrected the problem! We are amazed by the details of the door as well as the customer service. Would definitely recommended MD Doors to anyone looking to upgrade their Doors or Windows!\nS. L.\nOakville\nWe looked around a lot before finding MD Doors. They have a great selection of door inserts and a professional staff who is willing to work with the client to converge on a great door and insert selection.\nNatalie\nRichmond Hill\nWe ordered the custom made fiberglass doors with European locking system from MD Doors.

Those rural roots continue to provide inspiration for my designs.\nI live in Winnipeg, Manitoba, where, in the past, I taught French, English and art, worked as a photographer, and was employed at a stained glass studio.\nI founded my own business called Glass Act, working out of a studio in my home.

Something that decorates or adorns; an embellishment, an object that adds beauty to something.\n\nFiligree glass was invented in Murano by glass masters Filippo and Bernardo Serena in 1527, an elaborate process that was indeed difficult to perform. It would be 10 years before other glassmakers on the Island of Murano would reproduce , copy or imitate this technique and hundreds of years before this secret would be revealed to the rest of the world. Filigree Glass, unlike conventional blown glass, was suitable for only the uppermost tables of society as it was not common. This elaborate form of Filigrana Glass is responsible for the fame of Murano style glass today. Currently, with new design innovations and increasing levels of workmanship, the patterns able to be embedded in filigree glass appear to be limitless. Bringing much appreciation and joy to collectors of the beloved Filigree Glass technique.\n\nToday after much experimentation, Virginia Wilson Toccalino brings you lovely Filigree and Ribbon Glass Icicles. Each filigree, lace-like cane is composed of groups of glass rods that involve a process of fusing, layering pulling and twisting the glass. This process is done personally by Virginia and her husband Tony Toccalino at the furnace while working in their glass studio. The ribbon glass icicles are selected pieces of flattened colored glass embedded in the crystal, pulled and twisted to create swirling glass ribbons within. Colors and dimensions may vary slightly.

In the event of breaking, it is held in place by an interlayer between its two or more layers of glass.\nREAD MORE\nGLASS PAINTING\nBack painted or coated glass is a modern alternative to other surfacing materials such as tiles and laminates in the world's decorative and architectural industries.\nREAD MORE\nGLASS TEMPERING\nTempered glass is a type of safety glass processed by controlled thermal or chemical treatments to increase its strength compared with normal glass.\nREAD MORE\nHEAT SOAK TESTING\nHeat soak testing is a technique used to minimize the risk of spontaneous tempered glass breakage due to nickel sulphide inclusions within the glass installed in a building.\nREAD MORE\nHEAT STRENGTHENING\nThis is the process that makes the glass four to five times stronger than untreated glass. As a result, tempered glass is less likely to experience a thermal break.\nREAD MORE\nSTRAIGHT EDGE POLISHING\nStraight or flat edge glass polishing refers to the fine grinding of glass by abrasives to produce smooth surfaces or for artistic purposes.\nREAD MORE\nQUALITY COMES FIRST\nWe're a cutting-edge Glass Fabrication factory.

Research from Natural Resources Canada suggests that because of the Canadian climate, we spend far more money each year on heating than we do on cooling our homes \u2014 which adds up to a lot of wasted money. ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified windows can not only help cut your energy costs, they go a long way to reducing the carbon footprint of your home.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe \u2018ALL\u2019 in our name means you came to the right place.\n\nExtreme weather separates good windows and doors, from bad ones. Born and raised on the Canadian prairies, we know what it takes to make products that stand up to Canada\u2019s unpredictable seasons. From heavy west coast rain to unforgiving blizzards, bitter cold and blistering heat, our products are designed and tested for whatever the weather has in store.\n\nCanadian made.\n\nIn extreme climates, performance is the ultimate measure of quality. Our state-of-the-art window and door manufacturing facility changed the game nearly 20-years ago. Spanning 286,000 square feet, it\u2019s where craft and creativity combine to make the best windows, doors and glass in Canada, period.\n\nSmart savings.\nAs one of ENERGY STAR\u00ae\u2019s most efficient manufacturers, we lead the scene for keeping it green. Partnering with key environmental organizations and building councils, we follow the strictest ENERGY STAR standards for quality framing, weather stripping and glass coating \u2014 helping home owners to reduce their energy costs and environmental footprint.\nSafety, above the standard.\n\nSafety is everything to us.

This facility will play a key role in North America\u2019s rapidly-growing renewable energy sector providing solar module manufacturers with reliable access to high-quality solar glass.\n\nLearn more about what we do\nLinkedin\n \nTwitter\n \nYoutube\nGlass is more important than ever\n\nAs the world urgently works to reduce emissions, the demand for solar and architectural glass is projected to grow significantly. New policies around the globe, like Canada\u2019s net-zero emissions commitment and the USA\u2019s plan to decarbonize their electrical grid, continue to drive demand to unprecedented heights.\n\nEnergy consumption from the electrical grid and energy usage in buildings are significant components of our collective carbon footprint. CPS glass can be used in solar panels \u2013 a key component of North American net-zero plans to reduce emissions.\n\nSee how we\u2019re helping sustainably fill the supply gap\nAn opportunity the size of a continent\n\nWith 100% of North America\u2019s patterned solar glass currently being imported, the lack of a made-in-North-America solution creates numerous challenges to our future customers. CPS is perfectly positioned to support development of a low-carbon domestic solar supply chain and support the transition to net-zero emissions. This will open up downstream opportunities for complementary businesses, economic growth, and job creation.\n\nLearn about our vision for the future\nRight project,\nright time,\nright place\n\nManitoba is the ideal location for our facility. We will operate our facility close to our silica deposit, access renewable energy, and utilize some of the world\u2019s most responsibly-sourced natural gas \u2014 all at very competitive operating costs. As one of North America\u2019s key shipping hubs, Manitoba provides ready access to markets and efficient shipping options. The project aligns with the Provincial Government\u2019s climate action priorities, sustainable development, job creation targets, and economic growth ambitions.\n\nContact: INFO@cpsmail.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 CPS\n\nFor Investors\nAbout Us\nStakeholder Relations\nContact Us\n\nSuite 2000, 715 5 Avenue SW\nCalgary AB T2P2X6"
