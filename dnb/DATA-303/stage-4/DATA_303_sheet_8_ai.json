Our people supported by our scope and breadth of capabilities are committed to providing our valued customers with excellence in all they do. As an ISO 9001:2015 certified company, ABS prides itself on offering personalized service that is backed by a team and plants capable of meeting your requirements.\n\nVIEW MORE\n\nPRODUCTION MACHINING SPECIALISTS TO THE USA\n\nFrom the inception of all programs, ABS builds a team of program managers and specialists dedicated to the successful management of each project who begin a collaborative review of all Quality, Manufacturing and Engineering requirements. Our in process manufacturing team, tracked with our ERP and Quality Department ensure a total customer satisfaction is achieved. With decades of supplier recognitions, for many critical components, ABS continues to be awarded programs globally, based on an solid commitment to quality, cost and reliability.\n\nCAPABILITIES\n\nABS: YOUR PROVEN, INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING PARTNER\n\nAs markets become increasingly competitive, integration is becoming a necessity for OEMs. ABS is an integrated machine shop which means we offer a complete manufacturing solution. We perform multiple steps along the supply chain including machining, heavy fabrication, welding, and assembly. Integrated manufacturers deliver significant value to OEMs by streamlining the manufacturing timeline, improving the reliability of the final part, and minimizing the number of suppliers involved \u2013 improving supply chain efficiency and reducing risks.\u00a0\n\n6 STATE OF THE ART PLANTS ...\n\nWithin our facilities, which houses over 50 cranes ranging in lift capacity from 5,000 pounds to 160 tons, servicing our massive installation of machine tools; 80 machine tools with some being the largest ever made.\n\n\u00a0\nAmericas\nReshoring Partners\nfor OEMs\nWHY PARTNER WITH ABS?\n\nNot just any manufacturer can create quality heavy fabrications. These projects require specific tools, equipment, and processes as well as personnel with the right skills and expertise to handle such large structures. With over 50 years of proven experience serving a variety of industries, ABS offers OEMs expertise, facilities, and time on tools to safely and successfully perform integrated heavy fabrication projects.\n\nAT ABS - QUALITY DRIVES US\n\nQuality is the key driver at ABS and is an integral part of every process we undertake, and our quality team works hand in hand with our manufacturing and engineering teams to ensure quality is part of every decision we make. We provide OEMs a reliable and dependable process that yields consistent results. Consistent quality is hard work and requires rigorous, on-going monitoring of every process from purchasing to manufacturing to distribution. But the effort and focus on quality is well worth the reward. Our robust quality control and quality assurance programs ensure uniform, high-quality parts, and are one of the reasons ABS stands out from the competition.\n\nAMERICAS RESHORING PARTNER FOR OEMS\n\nTo strengthen their supply chain while maintaining quality, many OEMs are relocating manufacturing closer to home \u2013 a process known as reshoring. Reshoring is the opposite of offshoring; and is simply bringing manufacturing back from overseas. Reshoring is a much more competitive and attractive option when Total Cost of Ownership and Brand Reputation are considered. Reshoring with a trusted manufacturing partner like ABS delivers superior quality, streamlined logistics, less inventory on water, and excellent proximity to U.S. and Canada to maintain more control over the supply chain.\n\nCONTINUOUS INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGIES, FACILITIES, AND PEOPLE\n\nAt ABS, we know that we must invest in the future with state-of-the-art technologies in order to continue offering OEMs cutting-edge machining solutions. The culture of ABS drives continuous investment, and we are known for our capital investment initiatives to provide customers with the most advanced facilities and technologies. ABS invests regardless of economic cycles, and we also upgrade our existing capital to ensure all assets are leading edge in the industry. Our investments are not limited to equipment and software programs: we also continuously invest in and expand support staff roles such as, Safety, Quality, Engineering, and Production Control in order to better serve our clients.\n\nHeavy Fabrication Mig, Tig, Flux Core, Sub Arc\n\nFabrication \u2192\n\nMig, Tig, Flux Core, Sub Arc\n\n\u00a0\n\nInconel 625 Hotwire Tig\n\nSubsea \u2192\n\nInconel 625 Hotwire Tig\n\n\u00a0\n\nQuality Assurance & Control\n\nQuality \u2192\n\nQuality Assurance & Control\n\n\u00a0\n\nABS offers a unique combination of medium to high volume production machining and welding services.\n\nProduction \u2192\n\n80 Large Advanced CNC Machine Tools\n\n\u00a0\n\nABS is one of the largest and most advanced manufacturing companies in North America.\n\nHeavy \u2192\n\n6 Plants with lifting capacity up to 160 Tons\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe ABS 5-Axis machining department has been built from the ground up with our customers\u2019 needs in mind.\n\n5-Axis \u2192\n\nCentrifugal and Turbo Machined Impellers\n\n\u00a0\nMACHINING\n\nProduction Machining\nHeavy Machining\n5 Axis Machining\n\n\t\nFABRICATION\n\nHeavy Fabrication\n\nRobotic Welding\n\nAutomated Cladding & Subsea\n\n\n\t\nCONTACT US\n\n1.844.227.6224 (ABS.MACH)\n\nPh.#2: 905.625.5941\n\nFax: 905.238.9155\n\n\t\n\nABS MACHINING INC.\n\n\u00a9 1971 - 2025.

With over 50 years of specialized OEM experience, Nelson has mastered the art of delivering excellence on a grand scale. Our approach isn't about catering to everyone; it's about identifying our niche audience and making a significant impact.\n\nWe don't clinch contracts by undercutting our competitors on price; we win because we are unparalleled in our field. Our purpose, as articulated in Nelson's Statement, is to \"Be a company that Customers want to buy from, Employees want to work for and Ownership want to invest in\". This ethos drives us to continually innovate, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in manufacturing. Many of the products we manufacture are critical to the success of prominent brands while every project we undertake is a testament to our adaptability and expertise. Whether it's pioneering new product ideas or seamlessly executing complex fabrication processes, Nelson sets the benchmark for quality and reliability. Our state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, coupled with a highly skilled workforce, ensures that each product we deliver exceeds expectations.\n\n01. Contract Manufacturing\n\nWe are among our primary customers, which sets us apart. Nelson operates with a distinctive business model. Our Contract Manufacturing (CM) Division sustains two exclusive product lines: ACUDOR\u00a0 and AMD\u00a0. While our CM division reinforces our proprietary brands, these brands, in turn, enhance our ability to cater to OEM customers. Our ownership of these products allows us to grasp and appreciate the intricacies of product development, market temperament, promotion, distribution, and beyond. Our expertise in sheet metal fabrication shines particularly bright in fields like Science, Medical, Construction, and Automotive Dealerships. At Nelson, we don't just fabricate products; we forge enduring relationships. Our success as an OEM producer stems from our unwavering dedication to client satisfaction. With Nelson by your side, you're not just getting a manufacturer; you're gaining a partner committed to your success.\n\nThe measure of intelligence is the ability to change - Einstein\n\nThe Continuous Bench \u2013 spanning the shop from wall-to-wall.\nLexus Dealership continuous bench\nPorsche dealership certified shop furniture\n\nAREAS of EXPERTISE\n\nBefore Nelson was involved in designing auto dealership shop furniture, mechanics would work from drawer cabinets on wheels in each bay where efficiency was lost. Nelson began their research into better auto bay structures by looking at kitchen cabinet systems and how they used small space work areas to reduce steps and time. From that research came the Continuous Bench design, a configuration that spans the shop from wall-to-wall, ensuring the shop is free of gaps where clutter might collect. Nelson's modularity means that no system need be exactly the same, and its flexibility gives technicians the ability to customize their own workspace, to maximize their productivity.\n\nWe have been an OEM manufacturer of Lab furniture for more than 30 years with our products found in many of the top Universities and Research Institutes in N. America. In recent years our multitasking Lab Benches have found success as a complete system when matched with our cabinet series.\n\nNelson is the primary OEM manufacturer for a leading innovator in the medical equipment industry. This customer specializes in the development and distribution of forward-thinking products where infection control and cross-contamination is a concern.\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between busy and productive\n\nThe Beaty Biodiversity Museum\n\n02.\n\nAccess Products\n\nEstablishing the ACUDOR brand in 1976 marked the inception of safer access solutions, with our first round corner door and one-piece frame. Since then, ACUDOR has risen to global prominence, offering an unrivaled selection of access doors and hatches, solidifying its leadership position in the industry.\n\nACUDOR WEBSITE\n\n03.\n\nArchitectural Metals\n\nNelson's Architectural Metals Division (\u201cAMD\u201d) is known for providing innovative solutions for metal ceiling, wall, or decorative projects. Our team of engineers, designers, and fabricators are committed to providing turn-key supply solutions, often starting from just concept sketches.\n\nOver the past thirty years, we have worked on major transportation, infrastructure, hotel, and commercial projects throughout North America. We believe that craftsmanship can coexist with technology, and this belief has brought about significant changes that we embrace. Our achievements make us proud of the contribution we have made to the architect's catalog of options available.\n\nNELSONAMD WEBSITE\n\nHave questions or eager to discuss your ideas? Head over to our Contact page and share what's on your mind. We believe that creativity stems from brilliant ideas, and we have the tools and expertise to transform those concepts into tangible outcomes.\n\nYour Vision, Our Expertise\nRemember, an idea remains just that until you take action.

They wanted to replace the screws with permanent, tamper resistant fasteners that also supported lean manufacturing.\n\nSPIROL SOLUTION:\nSPIROL Engineering recommended replacing the screws with Press-N-Lok\u2122 Pins that were specifically designed as retention pins for plastic enclosures.\nPress-N-Lok\u2122 Pins have barbs that provide high retention in plastics. As the pins are pressed into the plastic, the barbs displace the plastic host material. After installation, the plastic backfills behind the barbs to lock the pins in place.\nThe assembly time for the Press-N-Lok\u2122 Pins was much quicker and the assembly equipment costs was lower compared to the screws previously used.\nSPIROL's Press-N-Lok\u2122 Pins simplified the assembly process, and eliminated scrap events associated with the installation of the screws.\nRead More\nMechanical Clutch in Heavy Duty Right Angle Drill\nCUSTOMER CHALLENGE:\n\nThe lead engineer at a prominent hand and power tool company contacted SPIROL for help determining the best Disc Spring design for a new lightweight, compact, and portable Heavy Duty Right Angle Drill.\n\nSPIROL SOLUTION:\nSPIROL Engineering designed two special Disc Springs stacked in series to meet the specific force and deflection requirements.\nDisc Springs offer a higher load capacity in less space as compared to conventional coil springs which enables the designer to make the tool more compact.\nUnlike Belleville Washers that are mostly used in static applications, Disc Springs provide unparalleled predictability, reliability and fatigue life in highly dynamic applications.\nBy partnering with SPIROL and incorporating our recommendation, the customer minimized costly development time and confidently launched their new high-quality drill to the market.\nRead More\nAlignment Dowels in Lower Engine Block\nCUSTOMER CHALLENGE:\n\nA leading automotive manufacturer approached SPIROL for a cost-effective solution to precision align the lower engine block to the primary engine block.\n\nSPIROL SOLUTION:\nSPIROL's GD100 Ground Hollow Dowels are used where centerline tolerance and precision alignment are required as they maintain critical alignment within 20 \u00b5m.\nGD100 Ground Hollow Dowel reduce weight by over 50% as compared to the same size Solid Dowel.\nSPIROL's recommendation resulted in over $100,000 in annual cost savings as compared to other alignment options considered.\nRead More\nConveyor Spacers\nCUSTOMER CHALLENGE:\n\nThe lead engineer at an industrial conveyor manufacturing company approached SPIROL to help resolve an issue caused by low quality plastic tubing used to separate skate wheel rollers from each other and from the conveyor walls.\n\nSPIROL SOLUTION:\nSPIROL's Application Engineers recommended replacing low cost, low quality plastic tubing with SPIROL's CS100 Conveyor Spacers\nCS100 Conveyor Spacers are stronger than plastic tubing and competitively priced.\nSPIROL's proprietary roll forming process enables custom lengths produced with no tool charges and fast turnaround times.\nBy partnering with SPIROL, the conveyor manufacturer was able to improve the quality of the assembly while concurrently controlling costs and inventory.\nRead More\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nHAVE A QUESTION?\nWe're Here to Help!\n\nHave a manufacturing issue you can't solve?

This is not to be confused with sandblasting, which is a similar method. However, sand is used rather than shot. Blasting is used in a wide variety of industries including, steel, forging and the aerospace industry. This is because it is often regarded as one of the most effective tools, while maintain cost effective results.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nPowder Coating\n\nIn addition to being durable, powder coating is an attractive choice due to environmental advantages.\n\nPowder coating is a high-quality finish found on thousands of products you come in contact with each day. Powder coating protects the roughest, toughest machinery as well as the household items you depend on daily. It provides a more durable finish than liquid paints can offer, while still providing an attractive finish. Powder coated products are more resistant to diminished coating quality as a result of impact, moisture, chemicals, ultraviolet light, and other extreme weather conditions. In turn, this reduces the risk of scratches, chipping, abrasions, corrosion, fading, and other wear issues.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\n\nCNC Shop\n\nOur Machine shop has high end mills and lathes that will hit the tolerances you need.

It absorbs or changes vibration energy, reducing the amount of energy transmitted through the equipment or structure. Understanding these processes \u2014 and when to use them \u2014 also requires understanding two concepts: transmissibility and natural frequency.\n\nVibration isolation\u00a0prevents vibration transmission. It keeps vibration energy from entering an object, such as a structure or piece of equipment.\n\nStructural Thermal Break Canada\nView More Products\n\nAll sizes and thickness of\u00a0Slide Bearings, Expansion Bearings\u00a0and\u00a0Elastomeic Bearings\u00a0are in stock in Canada and available for shipment anywhere in North America.\nSame day shipping is available on full sheets and expedited services are available for cut parts.

It is manufacturing equipment used to measure the geometrical shape of physical objects. It probes discrete points on the object's surface and detects the object's geometry based on those points. Primarily, CMM is used to ensure the quality of a part. It tests the machine part and determines whether it fulfills the intent of the original design. That is why CMMs are included in quality control to assure the quality of each component produced by the design and manufacturing company.\n\nWIRED EDM\n\nWired EDM (Electrical Discharge Machining) is an advanced machining process where a single strand of wire is used as an electrode. This wire gives out electrical sparks, which aids erode material in the desired piece. It works with great precision and high accuracy. Wired EDM is mainly used to cut all the way through the material because it creates a linear line. It is often used to form dies, tools, cut hard plates, and give them a finished look.\n\nMETAL STAMPING\n\nAs the name suggests, metal stamping is the process of pressing flat metal pieces to shape them up. It converts flat metal sheets into specific and complex shapes. The manufacturing process consists of many metal forming techniques, such as punching, blanking, embossing, bending, piercing, etc. Metal stamping is a budget-friendly and speedy method to produce large quantities to fulfill manufacturing needs. Various companies look for metal parts for their projects and require material manufactured with high precision.\n\nPROJECT MANAGEMENT\n\nProject management is the process of planning, organizing, and implementing project activities and fulfilling their requirements. It involves employing resources to control the management, meet deadlines, and enhance profitability. From an idea till its execution, all the activities related to work are part of it. Projects are divided into milestones, and each milestone is achieved according to the schedule. It helps companies complete their projects on time and at a low cost.\n\nTUBE BENDING & ASSEMBLY\n\nTube bending allows the bending of tubes and pipes according to the specified requirements. Many projects required bent pipes for the maintenance of the structure. So, the tube bending services provide tubes in all shapes (curved, square, rectangle) and sizes. Tube bending and assembly are required for industrial, commercial, architectural, structural, and recreational usage. Tubes of different metals are bent to form various shapes as per the specifications.\n\nMETAL STAMPING PARTS\n\nMetal stamping leads to the manufacturing of metal stamped parts. It involves pressing flat metal sheets into a stamping press, which eventually forms the desired shape with the tool and dies. Metal stamping services include blanking, coining, embossing, bending, and punching to shape the material. Customized metal stamping parts are also available for different industries. Industries require parts as per their needs and application. So, the metal stamping process ensures all components meet exact specifications and produce in bulk.\n\nCUSTOM DIE MAKING\n\nA die could be anything that transforms the material into a customized shape or product. Dies are pre-shaped tools that press onto the materials such as metal or plastic. The press applies force on the material and cuts hard through it. As a result, the material takes shape and size of the die. Every project has a different requirement of the dies. So, customized dies are produced to match the specification and capabilities of the project. Custom dies are manufactured according to their application and industry needs.\n\nCNC MACHINING\n\nComputer Numerical Control (CNC) machining is a process of manufacturing through pre-programmed software. The computerized software controls the movements of the tools and machines. Many industries have incorporated CNC machining in their manufacturing. A CNC machine is capable of performing complex tasks and cuts through the material in three dimensions. It doesn\u2019t require the aid of human operators as the machine functions on its own.\n\nTESTING\n\nTesting procedures and solutions are employed to ensure the quality of the product. Testing helps in assuring that the product is as per the standards for consumer use. It verifies that the manufacturing design is correct and the product is of high quality. Testing solutions aid in maximizing a company's profitability. Integrating reliable testing in the manufacturing process ensures the product's safety and facilitates the manufacturing process.\n\nVIDEOS\nPlay Video\nPlay Video\nPlay Video\nOUR STORY\nAbout us\n\nOlympic Tool & Die Inc. has been serving many industries since 1976 as a design and manufacturing company. We have built our reputation by providing high-quality products and efficient functions. We are ISO registered with the no. ISO 9001:2015, to provide design, refurbishing, and manufacturing of tools, dies, and fixtures.\n\nOur Mission:\nOlympic Tool & Die Inc. is committed to providing quality work and innovative manufacturing solutions to our customers. We have employed the best team with tremendous skills and vast experience for tool and die designs and manufacturing. We aim to provide completed projects on time.\n\nOur Vision:\nWe strive to be the best tool and dies maker and supplier for various industries while bringing innovations in our technology.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat We Do?\n\nOlympic Tool & Die Inc. covers all aspects of manufacturing and designing as a tool and dies maker. We offer the following:\n\nProgressive Dies\n\nProgressive dies consist of a series of operations in which one stroke follows the other. The workpiece stays attached to the base while different strokes perform the functions. With each stroke, the piece moves towards completion. Progressive dies increase the punching productivity and work efficiently.\u00a0\n\nTransfer Dies\u00a0\n\nTransfer die is similar to progressive die except that an individual unit works on each part. The parts have to be transported to multiple stations designated for all the operations; one station performs one stroke.\u00a0\n\nDraw Dies\n\nDraw dies punch into the metal sheet to form a shape. It takes control of the boundary and holds it firmly with a blank holder.\u00a0\n\nForming Dies\u00a0\n\nForming dies are similar to stencils but in industrial size. It is a manufacturing tool that presses hard into the metal and gives it specific shapes.\u00a0\n\nRoll Form\n\nRoll forming is another approach used for metal shaping. This process involves the continuous bending of long metal strips with a set of rollers.\u00a0\n\nPrototypes\n\nPrototypes are referred to as early models of a product built for testing. It demonstrates the process and purpose of that product before its launch.\u00a0\n\nBlanking Dies\n\nBlanking dies are used for cutting the metal piece. It produces a flat piece of material in the desired shape by cutting it in one operation. It only cuts the edges and is not used for parts with internal features.\u00a0\n\nSwage Dies Compound\n\nIt is another technique for metal formation. The edges or dimensions of the metal are deformed to fit around another part by pressing it.\n\nDies Secondary Operation\n\nDies secondary operations include those processes that are done after the initial manufacturing operations.

We offer extraordinary talent, craftsmanship, and state of the art equipment to complete any project or task requested, on time with quality, accuracy, and professionalism. Bantry Metal Products proactively seeks, researches, and acquires equipment to fulfill industry demands such that we can continue to improve and offer quality product to our clients with precision and competitive prices as we have since 1976.\n\nFEATURED SERVICES\nFLOW JET\n\nBecause there is absolutely no mechanical stress, heat distortion or heat-affected zone (HAZ), secondary processing can usually be eliminated. Get a satin smooth edge directly off the waterjet table.\n\n\nLearn More\n\nMETAL FORMING\n\nForming, or metal forming, is the metalworking process of fashioning metal parts and objects through mechanical deformation; the workpiece is reshaped without adding or removing material, and its mass remains unchanged.\n\nLearn More\n\nMETAL PUNCHING\n\nPunching is a metal forming process that uses a punch press to force a tool, called a punch, through the workpiece to create a hole via shearing. The punch often passes through the work into a die.\n\n\n\nLearn More\n\nMETAL SHEARING\n\nShearing is a process which cuts stock without the formation of chips, burning or melting. In technical terms, the process of \"shearing\" involves the use of straight cutting bladesorm of sheet metal or plates.\n\n\nLearn More\n\nMETAL ROLLING\n\nRolling is a metal forming process in which metal stock is passed through 2 rolls to reduce the thickness and to ultimately make the thickness uniform. Rolling is classified according to the temperature of the metal rolled.\n\n\nLearn More\n\nWELDING\n\nWelding is a fabrication or sculptural process that joins materials, usually metals by causing fusion, which is distinct from lower temperature metal-joining techniques such as brazing and soldering, which do not melt the base metal.\n\n\nLearn More\n\nMINI GALLERY\nFLOW MACH 2 WATERJET\n\nBantry Metal Products is pleased to announce the introduction of the state of the art flow mach 2 waterjet to our customer metal fabrication line up. The Flow Mach allows for precision cutting with tolerances near 0.005, resulting in a product with clean smooth edges.

Armor plate is sourced from northern Europe and several exclusive mold and die steels are sourced from Japan.\n\nIn the early 1970\u2019s, the company designed, developed and tested a heavy duty high performance Rock Injector Pile Point used to protect and seat steel piles being driven into sloping rock in the Precambrian shield. This innovated pile point continues to be specified by governments and geotechnical engineers across North America.\n\nIn the decades since, our industrial steel supply the company has grown, moving to ever-larger industrial steel supply facilities. We have offices and warehouses in Toronto, Ontario and Cartersville, Georgia.\n\nWe work hard to build lasting relationships with our suppliers and our customers. We are experts in the field of\u00a0wear and impact resistant products. Titus Steel products and solutions enable our customers to reduce downtime, increase payload and protect their employees. We are driven by quality and innovation solutions.\n\nWe are \u2013 \u201cThe Abrasion and Impact Wear Steel Specialists\u201d\n\nABOUT US\nHow Can We Help You\n\nTo find out how these superior WEAR STEELS can solve all your impact and abrasion problems, call us.\n\nAbrasion and Impact Wear Steel Specialists Since 1957\n\nCALL TODAY\nRecent Blogs\nWhat\u2019s the Difference Between Steel vs Titanium?\nAPRIL 18, 20240 COMMENTS\n\nSteel and titanium are the go-to elements for designers looking for rugged and tough materials.

Recommend to anyone who is looking for Canadian Uniform needs.\nJonah Carlson\nOH MY GOODNESS! Their court mounting is absolutely amazing. I sent my medals all the way from BC and got them back within a week. They look wonderful and they were so nice ! 10/10 definitely would recommend to everyone !\nSarah Miller\nWilliam Scully Ltd is Canada's premier uniform cap maker. I am a collector and they have made several historic replica caps for me that could not be found or made anywhere else. They have been government and MOD contractors since their inception in 1877, that's amazing! Their experience and knowledge is unmatched and Josee, their caps Manager is wonderful to work with. Just send an e-mail and photo of what you may want and it gets done correctly. I ordered a Canadian Grenadier Guards Officer's No.1 Cap from them and it is perfect. It was also about half the cost of what I may have paid from a UK maker. Don't buy a reproduction from anywhere else! they're all wrong.\nKirk Manning\nOrdered three forage caps for my wedding, they were completed and delivered in the shortest delay possible. Although there was a slight mistake, the gang at Scully's quickly rectified it and went beyond what I had expected. I would strongly recommend them.\nRich Law\nIn this day and age, to have such top notch, personalized service was SO refreshing. The family history of service to our country and the fast, professional service made buying from Scully an obvious choice. The sword I received was exactly as described and was to Regimental Standards. Only shop here if you want the best; and are interesred in professional and knowledgeable staff.\nGavin Duffy\nHello I have received my service medals today. I would like to Thank you so much for the very professional workmanship of my service medals. You can be sure that I will spread the word to everyone in my surrounding.\nEdouard Boisjoly\nMy Grandfather was a fighter pilot in the R.C.A.F during WWII. I was entrusted with his war medals, and needed a way to showcase them proudly in my home office. William Scully Ltd did an impeccable job at restoring these medals, and because of their meticulous care, the medals are now safeguarded within a glass case, perfectly restored. I highly recommend the services of Will Scully Ltd, as not only did they perfectly restore prized family heirlooms, they did so with outstanding service!\nGordon Watkin\nI prefer to have my medals mounted by Scully Ltd because they have incredible knowledge and expertise, as well as, the work ethic to provide you with a superior product. I had my Afghan Campaign Star mounted by someone else and required Scully to fix them. I also enjoy the fact that this is probably one of the last, long standing Canadian family businesses who have supported the Canadian military with corporate knowledge of ceremonial uniform accoutrements and the likes for over 100 years!\nRobin Thibault\nWilliam Scully Ltd exceeded my expectations. I was in search of a very specific military patch and was amazed by the sheer volume of their inventory. The website is user friendly and I received my quote within the hour. What prompted me to write a review was their excellent customer service.

We purchased our PowerMate probably around 4 years ago, and it has been a blessing. Within a week it was actually nicknamed \"the new employee,\" and is still known as that today. I couldn't begin to count how many times it has helped us. Having a 24 hour emergency service department, we never know when the need to lift, carry, load or move a piece of equipment will come up.\n\nAlso it is wonderful because we don't have the room for a forklift or any larger type of equipment. I myself have been in situations where I had an emergency call on a weekend, and instead of calling someone in to help load a unit, I use \"the new employee.\" I've actually showed up on job sites with large pieces of equipment, whether it a furnace, A/C, hot water heater, etc, and the customers are amazed at how a \"little guy\" like myself managed to load it into the truck.\n\nOur PowerMate never ceases to amaze everyone. I could go on and on about how much we like it and everything it's capable of. The customer service department at PowerMate is also great. We receive several friendly calls every year reminding us of maintenance and asking how our PowerMate is working out. Instead of hundreds of annoying sales calls that take up time, they are short and sweet and very respectful. Although we have had no problems at all with our PowerMate, I have no doubt that they will help and take care of it quickly and the best they can.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to recommend PowerMate to anyone. It's a wonderful low-maintenance piece of equipment that we use on a day-to-day basis. We love \"our new employee.\"\n\nThanks\n\nDustin Hess\nManager and HVAC Technician\nWebb Electrical Heating and Cooling\nFairmont, WV\n\nREAD MORE customer testimonial letters!\n\nHome \u00a0|\u00a0 Sitemap \u00a0|\u00a0 PowerMate Applications \u00a0|\u00a0 PowerMate Industry Segments \u00a0|\u00a0 PowerMate HandTrucks\nPowerMate Brochures \u00a0|\u00a0 PowerMate Stairclimbers Photo Gallery \u00a0|\u00a0 PowerMate HandTruck Videos\nCompany Information \u00a0|\u00a0 Contact Us \u00a0|\u00a0 PowerMate Careers \u00a0|\u00a0 PowerMate Customer Service\nPowerMate Customer Testimonials \u00a0|\u00a0 PowerMate Links \u00a0|\u00a0 Privacy - Terms Of Use \u00a0|\u00a0 PowerMate BLOG\n\nCopyright 2024 \u00a9 L P International Inc. / PowerMate \u00ae\nBox 696, 151 Savannah Oaks Dr., Brantford, Ontario N3T 5P9\nToll Free: 1-800-697-6283 Telephone: (519) 759-3292\nFax: (519) 759-3298 Email: info@powermate.info\n\nRequest Pricing\n\nCheck out our BLOG!\nRead great articles on maximizing profit, ergonomics, safety moving and more!\n\n\u00a0\n\nNew Blog Articles:\n\u201cThe Guy with the Machine\u201d - A Customer Testimonial\nNew Solution for Moving Test Weights - Elevator Industry\nNEW Lifting Solutions for Today's Vehicles!\nWater Heater Tank Moving Solutions!\nAdvantages of Drive Screw Technology\nStairs Are Not the Enemy! - \"Hand Truck Tips & Tricks\"\nA Customer's Stair Climber Experience - T.

With a comprehensive approach to surface preparation, MPL utilizes a 5-stage pre-treatment system to ensure optimal adhesion and long-lasting results. One of MPL's key specializations is in providing exceptional powder coating services for aluminum parts. The facility has extensive expertise in working with aluminum substrates and understands the specific requirements and challenges associated with coating this material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\nConsulting Services\n\nfor Small & Big\u00a0 jobs\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEnsuring we provide you with the services that you require.\n\n\n\n\nContact us for your needs, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick quote\nTailored solutions\nFast turnaround time\n\n\n\n\nLets not wait to get started.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to our dedication to quality, small part volume, and environmental care, MPL, our highly efficient small powder coating company, also employs a professional green pre-treatment process. This innovative pre-treatment method ensures optimal surface preparation while minimizing the environmental impact associated with traditional pre-treatment techniques.\nAt MPL, we recognize that proper pre-treatment is crucial for achieving long-lasting, high-quality powder coating finishes. However, traditional pre-treatment methods often involve the use of harsh chemicals and generate harmful byproducts. To address these concerns, we have invested in advanced green pre-treatment technology that offers both superior results and eco-friendliness.\nOur professional green pre-treatment process involves the use of environmentally friendly solutions that are non-toxic and biodegradable. These solutions effectively clean and prepare the surfaces of the parts, ensuring excellent adhesion and durability of the powder coating. By eliminating or reducing the use of hazardous chemicals, we minimize the risk to our workers, the surrounding environment, and the wider community.\nFurthermore, the green pre-treatment process implemented by MPL is designed to optimize resource utilization. We carefully manage water consumption, ensuring efficient use and recycling wherever possible. By reducing water waste, we contribute to water conservation efforts and promote responsible resource management.\nThe professional green pre-treatment process not only meets strict environmental regulations but also delivers outstanding results. The surfaces of the parts are thoroughly cleaned and treated, creating an ideal foundation for the powder coating to adhere to. This results in finishes that exhibit superior durability, corrosion resistance, and color vibrancy.\nBy incorporating professional green pre-treatment into our workflow, MPL exemplifies our commitment to sustainability and responsible practices. Clients can have peace of mind knowing that their parts undergo a safe and environmentally conscious pre-treatment process, ensuring both exceptional powder coating results and a reduced ecological impact.\nIn summary, MPL, our highly efficient small powder coating company, places great importance on the professional green pre-treatment process. By utilizing environmentally friendly solutions and optimizing resource utilization, we achieve excellent surface preparation while minimizing our environmental footprint. Our commitment to sustainable practices ensures that our clients receive exceptional powder coating results while contributing to a greener and more environmentally conscious industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhat Our Clients Say\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve worked with Metal Protection Lenoli for many years now and they have always offered a great customer experience.

L'entreprise oeuvre dans les secteurs commercial, industriel et institutionnel.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Depuis 3 ans, M\u00e9todex conna\u00eet une croissance remarquable gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 son expertise dans son domaine. L'entreprise se d\u00e9marque par sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 livrer \u00e0 la perfection des projets dont la complexit\u00e9 donne du fil \u00e0 retordre \u00e0 ses concurrents. Bien au fait de cet avantage concurrentiel et de la comp\u00e9titivit\u00e9 de leurs prix, plusieurs entrepreneurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux ont une grande confiance en M\u00e9todex.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Au cours des derniers mois, M\u00e9todex a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs projets se d\u00e9marquant tant par leur envergure que leur degr\u00e9 de difficult\u00e9. Parmi ceux-ci, on retrouve la construction d'une usine de fabrication de microprocesseurs pour IBM \u00e0 Bromont, la construction de la Biblioth\u00e8que Monique-Corriveau \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec et la construction du nouveau centre de d\u00e9tention de Sorel-Tracy.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dans le cadre de ces projets, M\u00e9todex a d\u00fb installer des escaliers, des supports de murs et m\u00e9caniques dans des endroits \u00e0 environnement tr\u00e8s contr\u00f4l\u00e9.

Forte de ses r\u00e9alisations, l'entreprise s'inscrit en tant qu'ambassadrice de la r\u00e9gion de l'\u00c9rable.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M\u00e9todex n'a jamais eu peur de relever des d\u00e9fis et de s'adapter \u00e0 son march\u00e9. La compagnie a \u00e9volu\u00e9 \u00e0 travers les demandes de ses partenaires, d\u00e9veloppant de nouveaux services et de nouvelles fa\u00e7ons de faire afin de trouver ce cr\u00e9neau particulier qui le distingue.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0L'entreprise se d\u00e9marque \u00e9galement par sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 s'ajuster en cours de projet. Il est fr\u00e9quent que l'installation des m\u00e9taux ouvr\u00e9s comporte des d\u00e9fis que l'on n'avait pas discern\u00e9s au d\u00e9part. M\u00e9todex poss\u00e8de une expertise qui lui permettra de livrer les m\u00e9taux malgr\u00e9 le fait que les plans aient chang\u00e9 en cours de route.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Bref, c'est en b\u00e2tissant des partenariats solides avec des entrepreneurs qui ont une grande confiance en M\u00e9todex que l'entreprise a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de cro\u00eetre et de faire sa marque dans le domaine de la fabrication et \u00e0 l'installation d'escaliers, supports et gardes-corps sur mesure.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\t\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0C'est en excellant dans la r\u00e9alisation de projets complexes, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 ses concurrents ne r\u00e9ussissent pas \u00e0 \u00eatre comp\u00e9titifs, que M\u00e9todex s'est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e et s'est d\u00e9marqu\u00e9e de ses concurrents \u00e0 travers les ann\u00e9es. L'entreprise plessisvilloise s'est choisi un cr\u00e9neau de niche en r\u00e9ussissant \u00e0 livrer des projets complexes, sans encombre et dans les d\u00e9lais prescrits. Cette particularit\u00e9 lui a permis de se faire des alli\u00e9s parmi de nombreux entrepreneurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux. La qualit\u00e9 de ses escaliers et autres m\u00e9taux ouvr\u00e9s con\u00e7us sur mesures ont \u00e9galement fait sa renomm\u00e9e. M\u00e9todex excelle dans la planification de ses interventions sur les chantiers. Sachant qu'elle devra agir rapidement dans une fen\u00eatre de temps pr\u00e9cise lors de chantiers d'envergure, elle doit s'assurer de toujours intervenir en moment opportun afin d'\u00e9viter de retarder le chantier en cours. Cette synchronisation parfaite et son ex\u00e9cution sans faille font d'elle un sous-traitant mod\u00e8le.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cette fa\u00e7on de faire permet \u00e0 M\u00e9todex d'offrir un service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le de qualit\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieure. \u00c0 travers les ann\u00e9es, le r\u00e9f\u00e9rencement a fait son oeuvre aupr\u00e8s des divers entrepreneurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et a permis \u00e0 l'entreprise de maintenir une croissance soutenue.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNotre mission\n\n\u00a0\n\nOffrir \u00e0 nos clients des produits de haute pr\u00e9cision avec une finition de grande qualit\u00e9 tout en respectant leurs \u00e9ch\u00e9anciers et en leur recommandant les meilleures solutions. \u00catre constamment \u00e0 l'\u00e9coute de nos partenaires, afin d'atteindre une efficacit\u00e9 et une productivit\u00e9 optimale, est une priorit\u00e9 pour nous.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNos Valeurs\n\n\u00a0\n\nHonn\u00eatet\u00e9, cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9, transparence et respect.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNotre implication sociale\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M\u00e9todex a jet\u00e9 son d\u00e9volu sur Centraide, car il vient en aide \u00e0 8 organismes communautaires de la r\u00e9gion de l'\u00c9rable, dont : l'Organisme de r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration anti-pauvret\u00e9 de l'\u00c9rable (ORAP\u00c9), les maisons des jeunes de Plessisville, Princeville et de Saint-Ferdinand, ainsi que la Maison des familles de l'\u00c9rable.

HOYME Manufacturing Inc., since 1984, designs and manufactures unique energy efficient Motorized Air Control Dampers and devices for the Commercial and Residential heating and ventilation industries. Friendly to the environment plus meeting ventilation requirements, HMI HOYME Dampers and Accessories have proven to be well accepted by the HVAC industry across the United States and Canada.\n\nAir Control Technology Helps Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n\nAir Control Technology\n\nUniversity of Alberta \u2013 Department of Mechanical Engineering\n\nCombustion Air Dampers vs Combustion Air Pots\n\nCheck out our Brochure on our Hoyme Furnace Fan Generated Air Exchanger(HRV)\n\nCheck out our Brochure on How to Get the Most from your Mid and Hi Efficient Heating Systems!\n\nThe COMBUSTION FRESH AIR DAMPER, Series \u2018 HOM \u2018 is motorized and used for the control of fresh air for combustion. It is patented and Code Certified to be field installed and interlocked with a thermostat of a furnace or aqua-stat of a boiler, using either oil, propane or natural gas. The damper is placed at the terminating end of an Insulated Fresh Air Inlet Duct beside the furnace. When the thermostat asks for heat, this Motorized Damper opens to allow fresh air for complete combustion. When the furnace stops, the damper closes to prevent the entry of unnecessary cold air. This results in added comfort with a definite saving of fuel.\n\nAnother HMI HOYME Damper is the Series \u2018 HAC \u2018 AIR CONTROL DAMPER,\u00a0 These Dampers are placed in-line and are used for FRESH AIR VENTILATION and ZONE\u00a0AIR CONTROL. When used for ventilation, any Exhaust Fan turned on will open the Fresh Air Damper and thus fresh air is brought in to replace air being exhausted.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHMI HOYME also manufactures a CSA Certified Flue Damper called a \u2018 HAC-F \u2018 Flue Damper \u2013 These dampers are placed in-line and are designed to save energy by stopping the escape of warm air up the chimney vent while the heating appliance is not firing and is interlocked to be open during firing. This damper is spring loaded and fails-safe-open in the event of power failure.\n\nYes! HMI HOYME Manufacturing also makes Rectangular Dampers, known as the HCR and HSI series which are available as a single blade rectangular and also an easy install slip-in type. These are available by customer request and are made with the same care and attention as our famous round dampers. The standard dampers are 24 volt, Power Open or Power Close with optional End Switches. They can be outfitted with our patented drive motors or various types of larger Belimo motors with various shaft sizes. Contact factory for ordering information.\n\n\nCheck out our Interface Relay Adaptors page. These adaptors have a number of uses related to controlling our Fresh Air Dampers and interlocking with but not interfering with your existing HVAC system. They are also useful for zone air control, with a thermostat in each room it will open the damper for proper air flow to that room.\n\n\nClick on\u00a0Furnace Fan Generated Air Exchangers\u00a0for another innovative product developed by HMI HOYME Manufacturing Inc. that saves you money and adds comfort to your home.\n\nCheck out our Latest Brochure on Furnace fan Generated Hi-Efficiency Counter-Flow Air to Air Heat Exchanger!\n\nHMI HOYME dampers are Canadian-made helping save you money and live in comfort.

Of course the market for\u00a0manifolds\u00a0is often considered a commodity one, resulting often in chaos on site, where a non-specialised contractor has to spend a lot of time and manpower to make heads or tails from all separate components, resulting in mistakes, wrong assembling, leakage, loss of parts and sometimes even dangerous or lethal and therefore costly failures. That is where the expertise and supply program of Multi Instruments Instrumentation comes to the rescue. No hassle on site, a \u201cplug-and-play\u201d solution delivered to the contractor/end-user, ready for installation, tagged, tested, well documented and assembled completely.\n\nView all products\nChoose a product type\nInstrument valves\nMore information\nManifold valves\nMore information\nInstrument Monoflanges\nMore information\nFlushing rings\nMore information\nClose Coupled monoflanges\nMore information\nHeated enclosure solutions\nMore information\nSunshade solutions\nMore information\nAccessories\nMore information\nQuestions?\nContact us.\n Instrumentation@multi-instruments.com\n NL: +31 (0)183 628888\n CA / USA: solutions@multi-instruments.com\n CA: + (1) (587) 269 - 4988\n\nFor information about pricing, solutions or availability, please contact us using the \u201cContact us button\u201d or by phone.\n\nContact\nOne stop global shopping\n\nTo be able to supply complete manifold solutions it is essential that all components within that solution are designed to match each other.That is where Multi Instruments Instrumentation differs from its competitors, as all products and parts used within instrumentation assemblies are engineered, produced and tested in-house, making it a perfect fit.

This was the first time our organization had anything like this, and it went even better than expected. From start to finish, Todd worked closely with our team to ensure the content of the training aligned with our expectations and unique needs. The feedback from those who attended training was overwhelmingly positive \u2013 they appreciated the extensive experience of the trainers, the use of real-world examples, and the 3rd party perspective of leadership best practices. We look forward to working with TMS Group again in the future and would highly recommend their high-quality services to any organization looking to develop their team.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDevyn Smit\n\nHR Coordinator, Inline Pigging Solutions\n\nIt\u2019s rare that you come across standout talent like Todd and The Municipal Services Group. I have had the pleasure of knowing Todd for more than five years, during which I had the opportunity to collaborate with him on several projects and initiatives. One such project that I benefited from his expertise and sage advice was the Medicine Hat Municipal Development Plan review. Todd's contributions helped with the successful commencement of this important project. I was impressed with Todd\u2019s leadership and ability to work with diverse stakeholders and drive projects to a successful conclusion. I would absolutely work with Todd again and highly recommend him to others for any complex project.\n\n\n\n\nKent Snyder\n\nBranch Manager, Planning and Environmental Services, City of Edmonton\n\nWe hired the TMS Group to help our Board of Directors with developing a strategic plan for our golf club.\u00a0 Our board had never been through an activity like this before, but the TMS Group tailored their approach to our needs. It resulted in a strategic plan that the whole Board believes in and is excited to get to work on. The whole process was light, easy to follow, and more affordable than we thought it would be.\n\n\n\n\nTim Collis\n\nPresident, Nanton Golf Club\n\nIt was an absolute pleasure working with Todd. He lead his team exceptionally well and had a disproportionate effect on the morale and welfare of the 137 families, and thousands of soldiers under training that passed through BATUS. Always outcome focused, Todd was able to balance fiscal constraints with absolute requirements and was impressive in the manner in which he kept everyone informed. I saw him make difficult decisions and enact change management to great effect. I would unequivocally recommend his work ethic and ability in role.\n\n\n\n\nLt Col (Ret'd) Andy Teskey\n\nBritish Army Training Unit, Suffield, AB\n\nCONTACT\n\nE: todd@tmsgroup.ca\n\nP: 403-828-0286\n\nThe Municipal Services (TMS) Group is a boutique firm that offers tailored support to organizations in the areas of good governance, leadership, and sustainability.\n\nNAVIGATION\n\nHome\n\nWhat We Do\n\nWhat We Offer\n\nOur Team\n\nSustainability\n\nSupport to Rec and Sports\n\n@ 2024 The Municipal Services (TMS) Group\nPage updated\nGoogle Sites\nReport abuse"

We are your destination if you\u2019re looking for lawn irrigation system products and services that go beyond your expectations. We don\u2019t only provide you with top-notch irrigation systems services, installation or repair, we offer you satisfaction-guaranteed work that will last years \u2014 and with a fitting warranty!\n\n\nEZ Lawn Sprinklers \u2014 Serving the GTA & Surrounding Areas for Over 35 Years\n\nEZ Lawn Sprinklers started with the goal of providing quality products to our customers along with excellent customer service. We take pride in our collaborative approach when it comes to your watering needs and knowing that no question goes unanswered. We believe in working together with you to nourish your lawn and garden while being able to conserve water at the same time.\n\nEasy-to-Use Sprinkler Systems\n\nOnce you learn the ins and outs of the system, your lawn maintenance will seem like it is on autopilot and you will be wondering why you didn\u2019t call us years ago. With our system, your lawn and gardens are always kept healthy without having to spend too much time and effort worrying about it.\n\nTailor-Fit Solutions for Your Lawn\n\nSize Matters\n\nOur core business is residential properties ranging from a few hundred square feet to ones over an acre. A lawn sprinkler or irrigation system for your property has to be specific to the size of your property, the sun it receives, the type of plant material and the amount of water pressure you have.\n\nStrategic Design\n\nWe design our systems to water the grass separately from the gardens and this is done by separating the system into various zones and by choosing the correct head for each area. Controlled by a fully automatic timer that is WIFI compatible, your system will eliminate the guessing of when to and how much water your lawn and garden require. An optional rain sensor will override the system in case of rain.\n\nA Lawn Sprinkler Company for All\n\nWe also service various commercial properties, condo buildings, strip malls, and places of worship.\n\nWhat You Can Expect From Our Toronto Lawn Sprinkler and Irrigation System Services\n\n5 Year Warranty\n\nThe standard warranty is 3 years. We, however, offer a 5-year warranty, which is longer than any of that offered by our competitors.\n\nNo Deposit\n\nWe don\u2019t ask you for a deposit. You pay upon completion.\n\nGuidance\n\nFor your reference, we will leave you with a package with descriptions regarding the components and their descriptions, uses, and maintenance requirements.\n\nNo Upselling\n\nWe won\u2019t sell you things you don\u2019t need.\n\n Request Quote\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServices Needed\nSprinkler Servicing\nNew Installation\n\ue61f\n\n\n\n\nWhy We Are One of the Best Toronto Sprinkler Companies\n\nWith over 30 years of experience in the irrigation business, our service is unmatched.\n\nSpecialized Company\n\nWe specialize in servicing and installing your lawn sprinklers.\n\nLicensed & Insured\n\nFully licensed and insured to cover any unforeseen issues. We will give you our insurance policy and WSIB paperwork up front.\n\nDependable Services\n\nWe love to take pride in the work we do. Each project is finished on time and on budget. Expect only a one-time visit \u2014 we\u2019ll get things done on the spot. We show up, install the system, show it to you, and even give you a tutorial on how it operates. We are organized and show up when we tell you, a testament to our commitment for quality services.\n\nDay Scheduling\n\nWe schedule your service appointment and visit your property on the same or next business day.\n\nFree Consultations\n\nWe offer free, no obligation quotes for new installations and will meet you at your property.\n\nReputable Company\n\nOperating for more than 35 years, earning a reputation for service and beautiful work.

We\u2019ll be right with you\n\nFAQs\n\nIs a sprinkler system better than watering by hand?\n\nYes, sprinkler systems save time, water, and deliver consistent coverage.\n\nHow often should I water my lawn with a sprinkler system?\n\nFrequency depends on weather, soil, and grass type. Twice a week in most cases, but adjust based on rainfall.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best time to water my lawn with a sprinkler system?\n\nEarly morning (4 am to 6 am) minimizes evaporation.\n\nHow much does a sprinkler system cost?\n\nAverage cost varies, but expect a few hundred to a thousand dollars depending on size and complexity.\n\nCan I install a sprinkler system myself?\n\nDIY systems exist, but professional installation ensures proper coverage and avoids buried utility line damage.\n\nWhat Our Clients Are Saying\nInstalled home sprinkler system very professionally and quickly, highly recommend. Was extremely competitive with pricing and had the most thoughtful overview of how to scope and deliver project. Seemless work\n- Jmo260686\n\nE-Z Lawn Sprinklers is definitely my top choice company to take care of my lawn. I have been with them for 20 years moving from one house to another. They always come to my rescue as soon as possible when I need them. When we were in Europe for the summer, E-Z Lawn Sprinklers made sure to keep our lawn green and fresh throughout scorching summer heat. They stay on top of the seasons by sending out notifications ahead of time to let us know they are coming so we could arrange our nanny to be home to greet them. Most of my friends and relatives\u2019 lawns are being maintained by E-Z Lawn Sprinklers. Highly Recommended!\n\n- William\n\nThis is an outstanding company, a pleasure to deal with \u2013 arrive on time and explain everything in detail. Every technician is knowledgeable and polite. I use this company for 2 years to shutoff and restart my system, they also did some minor repairs this year. Prices are very reasonable.\n\n- Pavel\n\nScott did a great job installing my backyard sprinkler system. He provided a very competitive quote, and was responsive to my emails and questions. He also worked around my sod installation to ensure the jobs would be completed together. Going forward, I expect Scott will continue to reply to any questions or concerns I have and provide great customer service. Thank you for an expert job, Scott!\n\n- Levto\n\n$85 for the yearly shut-down service, they come by, blow out our pipes and call it a year. Every \u2018technician\u2019 that has come by to help us thus far has been friendly, sociable and reliable. They come on time and get the job done. I had a small crack in a connection outside, they searched their van for a small part and fixed it for me free of charge.\n\nLast year a sprinkler head wasn\u2019t coming out of the ground and we didn\u2019t know it. They caught it, dug it up, repaired it for no extra charge, it was part of the regular maintenance.\n\nThey care about what they do and have good workers who are educated and professional.\n\n100% will continue service with EZ-Lawn sprinklers.\n\n- bmskarate\nA Complete Solution for Your Lawn Sprinkler Problems\nAre you looking for a reliable, honest company that actually answers your phone calls and doesn\u2019t disappear when you have a problem?

The 118 Siphon Gun is ideal for spraying polyurethanes, lacquers, stains, chalk paints, latex, enamels, alkyds, ceramic glazes, and even spray grade upholstery adhesives. Some material thinning may be required. Requires a \u00be hp compressor (not included) that can produce 2 \u2013 3 CFM (cubic feet per minute). The 118 Siphon Gun produces a 1/2\u2033 to 3\u2033circular spray pattern depending on the distance held from object spraying. Clean up is easy as a result of the simple design and utilization of mason jars for paint storage\n\nHow to Use\n\nThe 118 Siphon Gun by Critter Spray Products is easy to use. Start by pouring the material to be sprayed into the mason jar and secure to gun (some thinning may be required). Connect the gun to a \u00be hp or larger air compressor (not included). Pull the trigger and adjust the liquid nozzle position into the air stream to obtain the optimal circular spray pattern. Trial the spray pattern and paint transfer on a scrap piece of cardboard. Make adjustments to air pressure, liquid nozzle position and material viscosity as necessary. When ready to spray your projects, hold spray gun approximately 5\u201d away from surface to be painted. Pull the trigger and move across surface to be painted at a constant travel speed. Overlap each pass to obtain uniform coverage.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEASY TO USE\n\n\u00a0\n\nEASY TO CLEAN\n\nEmpty paint from jar, add a couple onces of thinners, remount jar to gun, splash thinners around and spray through nozzle, dissassemble, wipe down indicated surfaces and reassemble for the next use\n\nFEATURES\nLight weight \u2013 comfortable design\nStandard 16oz mason jar\n\nRequires a 3/4 hp or larger compressor that produces 2 -3 Cubic Feet/Minute (CFM )\nFast colour change when utilizing mason jars\n\nAdaptable to other containers\n\nSprays: Paints, Stains, Polyurethanes, Foam & Fabric Adhesives and Ceramic Glazes\n\nDISTRIBUTORS\n\n\n1 \u2013 800 \u2013 267 \u2013 8767 (CDN)\n\n1 \u2013 800 \u2013 874 \u2013 8158 (US)\nPart List Description\n\nAir Powered Spray Gun (Critter)\n\nMaintenance Kit (Aluminum Tube) #20310\n\nJar Gaskets (pkg of 5) #21525\n\nCatalogue #\n\n03K03.01\n\n03K03.02\n\n03K03.03\n\nPart List Description\n\nCritter Spray Gun\n\nMaintenance Kit (Aluminum Tube) #20310\n\nCatalogue #\n\nB00006FRPJ\n\nB00006FRPK\n\n1 \u2013 800 \u2013 241 \u2013 6748\nPart List Description\n\nCritter Spray Gun\n\nMaintenance Kit (Aluminum Tube) #20310\n\nJar Gaskets (pkg of 5) #21525\n\nMaintenance Kit (Aluminum Tube) #20310\n\nCatalogue #\n\n192701\n\n192720\n\n192710\n\n192719\n\nPROJECTS\nFreshen up that wicker furniture with a quick coat of latex enamel paint\nThis live edge bench was brought to life with several coats of a fast dry polyurethane\nUsed in the upholstery industry over 30 years spraying Foam and Fabric adhesives\nIdeal for applying ceramic and pottery glazes\nFinishing with chalk paint is a popular way to bring that old furniture back to life. The 118 Siphon Gun is a great tool to quickly apply a brush stroke free base.\nOil Based Rust Paint is being applied to this weathered yard trailer that was in need of a little attention.\nShutters can take a lot of time to finish using a brush. The 118 Siphon will do a beautiful job in a fraction of the time - without the brush marks.\nBeautiful polyrethane and lacquer finishes can be applied with professional results. No brush marks to spoil your efforts either.\nThese are great projects, you can save time finishing when using the 118 Siphon whether you are staining or painting\nWhether it is Chalk, Rust or High Temperature BBQ paint it takes very little time to revitalize antiques like this old metal milk can with a beautiful brush free finish.\n\nShown here is a oil based polyurethane finish being applied to this bench. Take note of the metal can used rather than the glass mason jar. A small paint can was drilled out and screwed onto the bottom of the gun.\nFAQ\u2019S (CRITTERS SPRAY PRODUCTS)\nThese are some of the most commonly asked questions:\n\nWhat is the spray pattern?\n\nthe 118 Sihon gun produces a circular spray pattern in size from 1/2\u2033 to 3\u2033 diameter\ndepending on the adjustment of the position of the tip of the liquid nozzle in the air stream. The closer to the surface you spray the narrower the spray pattern is. The further away from the surface you are spraying i.e. 4 to 6 inches, the larger the circular spray pattern is on the work surface.\n\nWhere can I get individual replacement parts?\n\nfollow this link to our distributor that carries many of the replacement parts individually https://www.highlandwoodworking.com/critter-spray-guns.aspx\n\nWon\u2019t connect to my hose\n\nThe quick connect plug is a \u201cM\u201d style 1/8\u2033NPT threaded plug. It is one of the most commonly used air hose connectors supplied on retail air tools. If your air tools are equipped with a different style of plug then you will need to purchase and install a 1\u20198\u2033 NPT to 1/4\u2033 NPS union to connect your style of quick connect plug to the 118 Siphon Gun.\n\nWon\u2019t spray\n\nCheck out the 118 Siphon Gun Setup video on this site for tips on how to remedy this issue These are the top issues that our customers encounter:\n\n1) Plugged vent hole in top of jar \u2013 clean vent hole so jar can breath\n2) Tube is plugged with solids or dried up material \u2013 pass pipe cleaner or bbq skewer through tube as shown in video\n3) Liquid nozzle is plugged with solid or dried up material \u2013 clean out material in nozzle with paper clip\n4) tip of liquid nozzle is not positioned in the middle of the air stream of air nozzle \u2013 adjust as indicated in video\n5) material is too thick and needs to be thinned \u2013 thin material and increase pressure (not all materials can be atomized\nwell enough to spray)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWon\u2019t stop spraying:\n\nThis can be caused by the air valve disc not sealing or a dry o-ring restricting movement of the air valve when the trigger is depressed. The first remedy is to apply a drop of oil on the air valve behind the trigger and depress the trigger back and forth to lubricate oil along the valve stem and into the oring just inside the casting. Also, excessive moisture from the compressor can migrate down the air lines, into the gun and corrode the air valve retaing washer.

This is more than just a business for us; it is something we are truly passionate about. We are always looking to not only meet but exceed our customers' expectations.\n\nHAND CAST PEWTER: ONLY COMPANY IN NORTH AMERICA\n\nMADE IN THE USA PRODUCTS\n\nSHOP NOW\nHandmade Pewter \u2013 Made in the USA\n\nWe pride ourselves on being the only North American company still using the same centuries-old hand-casting method for our pewter hollowware. Every piece, from toddler and baby cups to water goblets and wine glasses, candle holders, and beer steins, is made individually, one at a time, from bronze in molds. The doors of our workshop first opened in 1974, and from there, we have continued to design and make our molds and pewter gifts.\n\nFEATURED PRODUCTS\nOUR LOCATIONS\nVisit Our Locations for Handmade Pewter Ornaments and Pewter Collectables\n\nWe currently have a workshop and gift store at our original location, Hampshire Pewter, at Barclay Square in Somersworth, and a gift store in Wolfeboro.

Check out our collection of Christmas gifts here.\n\nPewter Baby Gifts\n\nThe birth of a child is a beautiful and monumental event for everyone involved, but especially for the newborn's parents. At Hampshire Pewter, we also design and hand-cast various baby gifts in bronze. These can range from engraved candle holders to practical items like spoons, drinking cups, picture frames, and different ornaments.\n\nWedding and Anniversary Pewter Ornaments\n\nCelebrate the big day of a couple you love with pewter ornaments hand-cast by our team of professionals, who are fully trained and experienced in the ancient art form. Rather than using modern practices, we still work on each item individually, creating old-fashioned casts. You can have a special message engraved into any of our pewter gifts for the couple in question, like the date of their big day, a vital quote phrase, or your best wishes and love.\n\nPewter Collectables and Jewelry\n\nWe also design and hand craft personalized jewelry and other accessories like bracelets, charms, purse mirrors, and keychains. Whether for a spouse, relative, or friend, we have beautiful and unique pewter gifts for everyone.
