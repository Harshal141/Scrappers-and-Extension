Please have a look around the website to see what products and services that we offer you, as well as what makes our company so unique.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe majority of polyethylene produced in North America is a by-product of natural gas \u2013 polyethylene is in fact derived from a waste product of the natural gas (used to heat our homes, etc.). The advent of a plastic has enabled this waste product to be redirected into a usable (and reusable) product instead of being burned (released) into the environment. In fact, most shopping bags (for example) are reused multiple times. Interestingly, plastic bags create only one third of the CO2 emissions than their paper counterparts, per-use. Further, according to a study commissioned by the U.K. Environment Agency in 2007, on a per-use basis, polyethylene shopping bags produce fewer carbon emissions than permanent, cloth bags, and were found to be only 0.5% as destructive to the climate as cloth bags on an average per-use basis.\n\nReady to get started?\n\nGet a quotation including a price and an estimated delivery time.\n\nGET STARTED\nHOME\nPRODUCTS\nSERVICES\nCONTACT US\nPOLYSON\nPOLYETHYLENE\nPRODUCTS\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Polyson Polyethylene Products 2013-2014.

It all started when my brother in law wanted to learn the butcher trade so he traveled to Germany to stay with family and learn at age 18. His dad, meat manager at Loblaws at the time, and mom a hairdresser and business woman encouraged him to move forward. Once he was home he began making sausage in his basement for fun and eventually started selling at the market. His younger brother, who was in University, ended up joining the business when it began. The processing plant was built a few years later and grew to accommodate the needs of customers demands for their products. I joined the business in 1994 and started working at the St. Jacobs market the day they got their first booth there. I worked at the processing plant and market for 3 years until we opened our first store in November of 1997 on Peel Street in New Hamburg. We opened our second store July 2000 (HWY 7&8 current location) and merged the two stores January of 2008. We are very happy to have the frozen foods & deli in one location!!\u00a0\n\nWe now sell frozen food; chicken, pork, beef, turkey, fruit, veggies, dessert, fish, fries, finger foods, soups, lasagna, deli items; cold cuts, kielbasa, smoked chops, fresh meats, sandwiches, hot soups, cold drinks, gluten free items,cheese, ready made meals and much more. Our busy deli is a hot spot for lunches and dinners!\u00a0\n\nWe processed almost all of our beef and pork products and are happy to say that we do not use msg, fillers, wheat or milk in our products. We also do not use fancy preservatives, thus giving our products a home-made taste and quality. We make all of our deli salads and soups at our store and take pride in providing high quality products and service to our customers. \u00a0In August of 2016 our beloved processing plant of almost 30 years, burnt down. \u00a0We have been blessed by the community support as we are still able to cut and marinate our own products and we have other plants making our processed meats with our recipes and meat. Blessed!!\u00a0\n\nWe continue to keep our small family owned and operated business at top standards. We are a Provincially Licensed Meat Plant.

Among our many services, we offer single-layer or multi-layered films and bags while adhering to international quality and food safety standards. We also offer recyclable and eco-friendly packaging products that produce a neutral carbon footprint.\n\nSince 1983, we are constantly adapting and evolving our techniques and equipment to stay ahead of the ever-changing trends of the industry. With a customer-focused mentality, we commit ourselves to always deliver a quality product with a quick turnaround time, an everyday standard at Port-Royal Packaging Inc.\u00a0 Having worked with many suppliers and customers within Canada and around the world in various industries, there is no project that we cannot handle.

Our attention to detail for every flexible packaging project is important for the success of all our clients.\n\nOur services\n\nBag/pouch making\n\nBeing a customhouse, we can create any pouch to your specifications, such as stand-up pouches, square bottom bags, simplex bags, spout bags, zipper bags, child-proof bags, wicket bags, coffee bags, etc.\n\nLamination\n\nBy combining two or more films together, laminated packaging products offer better shelf life by adding extra protection to environmental agents such as moisture and oxygen. They are also more resistant to tearing and are an overall sturdier end-product. Our solvent-less laminator allows us to eliminate chemicals in the lamination process and our steadfast production team uses the latest techniques to deliver top-quality products.\u00a0\n\nSlitting\n\nRewind slitting is an important step for converters in the flexible packaging industry. We can slit most materials while providing a high precision outcome to our customers.\n\nPrinting\n\nWe offer 11 colors in rotogravure and 10 colors in flexography printing. We also work with experienced graphic designers who can help our customers conceptualize their ideas and who understand the flexible packaging printing process.\n\nStorage\n\nWe understand that storage can be an issue for all. That is why we offer storage services for our customer\u2019s completed packaging products. We will work with you to handle the logistics and the delivery of goods.\n\nOur Packaging materials\nPort-Royal Packaging Inc. \n\nis always updating and expanding the materials and films available to our customers.\n\nOur materials\n\nKraft Paper\n\nMade from paperboard, kraft paper is characterized by high durability and tear resistance. One of the most common applications is for coffee bags and confectionary bags.\u00a0\n\nPolyethylene\n\nPolyethylene is the most common used material in the packaging industry. There are different types of films available, each with their own characteristics and uses. Polyethylene can be recycled.\n\nPolypropylene\n\nPolypropylene is the second most widely used material in the packaging industry. It has a slightly higher melting point than polyethylene and does not react with water and chemicals, making it more resistant.\n\nBiofilms\n\nDue to increased awareness about the environment on the international stage, biofilms are becoming increasingly popular. They are produced using biomass sources, notably cellulose, corn starch and wood pulp. However, it should be noted that not all biofilms are compostable and/or biodegradable.\u00a0\n\nPolyester\n\nPolyester is used in the packaging industry, mostly in the lamination process. One of the main reasons for its application is to increase the shelf life of a product.\u00a0\n\nNylon\n\nDue to its high heat resistance, nylon is a popular material when making oven and/or microwavable bags.

Having spent many years in the waste management business, Patrick was concerned with the traditional sales methods being used in the waste industry, that is, match a potential client\u2019s existing service with the same service but at a slightly reduced price. Traditionally, compactor and baler manufacturers sold equipment directly to haulage companies; such equipment however is counterproductive to a haulage companies profit which is based on frequent trash pick-ups. It is not in a haulage company\u2019s best interest to offer equipment for \u201cfull waste-stream services\u201d to their clients.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nNews & Events\n\nFind out about our latest news...\n\nNEW PLASTICS ECONOMY GLOBAL COMMITMENT\n\nOn Sunday October 28, 2018 at the \"Our Oceans\" conference in Bali, 275 brands, retailers, recyclers and governments collaborated on the \"New Plastics Economy\" Global commitment.

When you choose us for personalised stickers, you'll have the following range of material options at your disposal:\n\nPaper Materials\nGreen Paper\nYellow Paper\nSilver Paper\nBlue Paper\nGold Paper\nMatt White\nVinyl Materials\nYellow Vinyl Fluorescent\nAppliance Silver Vinyl Gloss\nVoid Silver Vinyl Matt\nHolographic Vinyl Tamper Evident\nSpecial Finishes\nClear\nMatt\nGloss\nMetallic Vinyl\nOur Adhesives\n\nWe have two main adhesive options: water-based adhesive and solvent adhesive. Our solvent-based adhesive is used on labels that might need to be on a while, such as product labels or safety/ equipment labels. Water-based adhesives are used where the solvent adhesive may otherwise cause damage, like on workwear.\n\nColours\n\nPrinted labels work for many reasons, like providing safety information on machinery or warning where danger is lurking. They're also needed for quality products to catch your eye on the shelf. Each of these uses would benefit from a different one of our range of colours, which is why we've committed to providing as many as possible!\n\nWhether you're looking for bright colours to catch a customer's eye, fluorescent day-glow colours that warn of danger or bold colours that deliver the safety message you want, you can be sure we can help.\n\nWhere Can Our Sticky Labels Be Applied?\n\nOur custom stickers can be applied almost anywhere! The most common areas of application are:\n\nSmooth Surfaces.\nOur quality stickers can be applied to a smooth surface with no problem;\nexamples of this would be\nLaptop stickers\nWindow stickers\nFlat product packaging\nFood packaging\nInternal packaging\nCurved Surfaces.\nNot all applications are flat, especially not the glass containers, jam jars and other bottles that labels need applying to.\nAnd how about those stickers for your guerilla marketing campaign? Our printed labels and stickers will adhere to curved surfaces without a problem.\n\nMore Information About Our Printed Label Services\n\nPricing Structure\nWe pride ourselves on providing an affordable price for a quality finish. We've been in business since 1973, and we understand how important it is to provide value to the tight budgets of small businesses.\nWe offer some of the cheapest labels on the market but have yet to sacrifice quality. Existing customers know us for our quality custom labels, proven by our 4.8-star rating on Trustpilot.\nIf you'd like to sample our competitive prices, choose the right product, and we'll give you an instant price at checkout.\nCustomisation Options We have an unbelievable range of customisation options, from practical, cheap stickers off the shelf to custom-cut products in a range of finishes and shapes.

One size doesn't fit all, and our custom shape labels allow us to find the right finished label design for your product and even multiple sizes on one run.\nOur Printing Process\nOur sticker printing service takes place at our headquarters in Lincolnshire.\n\n\nWe print stickers in a variety of ways:\nFor runs of 10,000 or less, we use the latest in digital printing, which provides extremely low production costs and allows us to provide our leading prices.\nFor orders over 10,000, we use a flexographic print; though we offset the production costs on set-up and plates with lower rates, it is still very affordable.\nWhat Is The Cost Of Delivery?\nWe guarantee dispatch within two days, though it is usually next-day delivery. If your order exceeds \u00a335, we'll also offer free delivery.\nOur delivery days are Monday - Friday, and orders missing dispatch on Friday will be dispatched to your delivery address on the next working day.\nIf you would like specific delivery dates on your order, give us a call or ask when placing your order, and we'll be happy to help.\n\n\nSTICKYLABELS.COM\nWhat is biodegradable?Everybody will be familiar with this term. Any particular item that can break down in natural elements and return to nature in the organic form can be termed as a biodegradable item.\nA Label for everything\nSticky labels are so useful, for so many reasons around the house and in everyday life. They can help you get organised, help you organise your family, and they can just cheer things up a little!...\n10 Great uses for Waterproof Labels\nWaterproof labels are hugely underrated in our honest opinion. They have a wide range of uses, from highly practical to entirely pointless (but fun), which we\u2019d like to share with you...\n\n\n\n\nLOCATION\n11 Mill Lane, Butterwick, Boston, Lincs, PE22 0JE, United Kingdom\n01205 808460\n@\nsales@stickylabels.com\n  \nUSEFUL LINKS\nLabel Categories\nHome\nContact Us\nAbout Us\nTerms & Conditions\nBlog\nEnvironmental Policy\nEqual Opportunities\nHistory\nFrequently Asked Questions\nIn The Community\nPrivacy Policy\nSitemap\nMon\n08:00 am - 16:30 pm\nTue\n08:00 am - 16:30 pm\nWed\n08:00 am - 16:30 pm\nThu\n08:00 am - 16:30 pm\nFri\n08:00 am - 16:30 pm\nSat\nClosed\nSun\nClosed\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Vine Lodge Products 2020.

What is the real difference?\n\nThe answer is \u2026 not much, mainly the intention of the use . Both, our personalized cutting boards and cheese boards are 0.75\u201d thick, come in various styles and sizes. However, the cutting board is primarily used to prepare and cut food while the cheese board is used to serve and share food. Saying that, many of our customers revolutionized that concept and use the cutting boards as serving platters with great pleasure.\n\nCutting Board VS Chopping Block. What is the real difference?\n\nAll cutting boards can handle light food prep work, but the chopping block is meant to handle the heavy duty chopping work \u2013 it\u2019s in the name! Straga\u2019s Chopping Blocks are all times kitchen chief\u2019s favourite: being 1.75 inches thick with handles carved on the sides for easy handling and a juice groove to prevent the messy spills in the kitchen.\n\nBoth our hardwood cutting boards and chopping blocks are gentle on the knives!

Green 2 Blue was founded in 2014 to meet this increasing demand for a cleaner energy alternative to fossil fuels.\n\nWith the production of wood pellets made from residual sawdust and wood waste, Green 2 Blue is able to provide a cleaner, renewable fuel to companies that generate and supply electricity. This enables European power plants that were previously fueled by coal to meet their corporate objectives of reducing emissions and ultimately their carbon footprint.\n\nOur mission is to create shareholder value by producing and selling high quality renewable energy products for our customers that improve the environmental impact from power generation.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWood pellets have become a growing source of renewable and sustainable energy generation in the UK and many countries across Europe because they are regarded as having a smaller carbon footprint than traditional fossil fuels and coal. We have also made it possible for all our projects to be constantly moved and relocated by using the services of a trusted company for man with van in East London called Get Man and Van. All our facilities and equipment is being transported when needed by the company cargo fleet safely and securely.\n\n\nGet In Touch\n\nLeave your name and email below along with what you are looking for in the message box.

Our goals are recyclability, affordability, protection, low volume and low cost setups.\n\nWhy choose pulp packaging?\nEnvironmentally Friendly\n\nMade from 100% recycled newsprint. Is 100% recyclable and compostable. Each insert is embossed with a Recycle Logo for proper after use disposal.\n\nSpace\n\nInserts are designed to be nested and stacked. This results in massive savings in storage and transportation costs for our clients.\n\nPerformance\n\nOur inserts are designed three dimensionally. This allows us to offer superior vibration, impact, and cushioning support than traditional die cut cardboard or foam.\n\nWhat makes us different?\nLow Volume\n\nWe are the only company that specializes in low volume inserts. Our clients range from large multinationals to small business owners that are looking for ways to improve their environmental footprint with a great packaging solution.\n\nLowest Cost Setup\n\nWe at Pulp Packaging have created a business to cater to low volume orders. This includes the lowest cost design, setup and molds in the industry.\u00a0\n\nShipping\n\nShipping is included in the price of our inserts because we are usually not located in your City. We include freight in the cost of our pulp molded inserts. This allows us to achieve the lowest cost all the way to your door and remove all hidden costs.\u00a0\n\nRobin at Pulp Packaging designed us an economical solution that made our delicate light bulbs safe and secure while also making the packaging smaller then our previous design.\n\nOur business aims to be enviromentally friendly from start to finish. Therefore, going with pulp packaging was a no brainer and an added touch our customers appreciated."

Going though years of competitive sports, had left injuries/ailments, biggest being the knee, with surgery, and arthritis there from my 20\u2019s\u2026.now 41. I chose a long time ago, to treat pain, inflammation and otherwise with food, as opposed to synthetic drugs.\u00a0\n\nSo after overcoming some potentially serious adversity with my stomach issue.

Many Natural Brands are there in the market and my experience with most of them has not been good but I am extremely happy with the Pure and Organic Products from ECObrownbox. I have recently ordered their Natural Deodorant Perfume Balm and I am super excited to get it delivered and use it. I love their Gift Bundles and am planning to Gift one to my Mom on her Birthday. Thank you Ecobrownbox for finally launching a true organic products brand.\nREENA SINGH\nSimply Outstanding Products! I loved the Alovera Face Glow Mask, it is the perfect face pack I have ever tried. I am using it as an overnight mask and it works just fabulous for my skin. I have been using it every day since I received it. It works well for my sensitive skin! Non Sticky and well hydrating! I also loved the Neem Wood Comb I ordered, amazing quality, and one can feel the true neem wood fragrance. I ordered Bamboo Toothbrushes for my family and we all are loving them so much. Spa Bars with Natural Loofah, that's just so amazing! I'm very satisfied with all the products I ordered from Ecobrownbox :-).\nSathya Raju\nThoroughly enjoyed using the Rose Bliss Soap Bar. Its mild fragrance lingers for a long time and gives a royal feel. I also loved the cute Jute pouch packaging of the soap Bar which is so beautiful and plastic-free. In fact, the Jute Pouch can be reused for keeping everyday essentials. I'm very satisfied\nRitu Vohra\nIn my quest to eliminate as much plastic as possible from my life, I bought 3 sets of Bamboo Toothbrushes with Charcoal Bristles, the bristles are soft and I found it much better than any single-use plastic toothbrushes. I thought it would wear off really quickly but even after a few weeks, it does fantastic cleaning each time. As a Dentist and Oral Maxillofacial Surgeon, I would definitely recommend bamboo toothbrushes from Ecobrownbox to anyone looking for a better, sustainable, and healthier alternative to their plastic toothbrushes. I also liked the plastic-free packaging, all the toothbrushes were delivered in a reusable Jute Pouch. Good product and Quality service!\nDr. Sanjay Jadwani\nSo happy with the quality of organic soaps. They smell heavenly and are so mild on the skin. Definitely, a must-try!Loved the packaging, the beautiful plastic-free box, and So True to the tagline \"Nature's Goodness in Every Box! I'm very satisfied with the Good product quality and impressed with zero-waste packaging.\nIshita Bhatnagar\nI ordered Chamomile Toner & Make-up Remover, Chamomile Soap Bar, and Bamboo Toothbrushes. All the products are of super quality and with a pleasant aroma that lasts almost a whole day. Chamomile Toner is too good; it easily removes makeup from my face and keeps my skin hydrated. My skin is sensitive, so I Don't experiment much, but when I tried the Soap Bars and Toner from ecobrownbox, I actually felt like trying other products as well. Every product came packed in plastic-free packaging, making it completely earth-friendly. Thanks!\nPrachi Khandelwal\nI happened to get a few items from them.

One more thing which I really appreciate is plastic-free packaging. I also ordered Chamomile Spa Bar and loved the fragrance, it's so pure that I started using it for face wash as well :-).\nHanisha Parikh\nI am super happy with the Ultimate Happiness Bundle that I ordered, it is just fabulous, it has everything that I wanted, Natural Neem Comb (Super Quality I must say), I had tried Neem Comb before but never got really good quality, wood start to chip off after a few days but this one from Ecobrownbox is just amazing!

This includes an understanding of basic and formal etiquette when interacting with the public at large, including peers, teachers, family and friends.\n\nOrder an Online Etiquette Program \u00bb\nGood Manners Matter\n\nWelcome to visitors from Canada and the United States. If you are outside of North America, welcome to you too!\n\nEtiquette, the rules and conventions that regulate social and professional behaviour, is the foundation for success in all aspects of life. It affects how we relate to and are perceived by others and, ultimately, the opportunities we are given.\n\nFor children, it can mean being invited to a friend\u2019s birthday party or included in play dates.\nFor teenagers, it can mean gaining entrance into a desired school or being hired for a part-time job.\nFor adults and business, it can mean getting a promotion that leads to a more comfortable lifestyle or having better customer relations and business success.\n\nEtiquette is not something you are born with\nEveryone can have good manners:\nIt\u2019s just a matter of learning the rules.\nBe happier, more confident, and successful\u2026\n\nBorn and educated in England, Elizabeth has a long family history in the practice of etiquette. Her great uncle was Toastmaster at one of London\u2019s well-established luxury hotels where he organized and conducted many executive and royal events always ensuring that proper etiquette was followed. Her great aunts in London and Geneva also provided advice and training on respectability, grooming, and decorum.\n\nIn and around the Vancouver area (as well as Skype), Elizabeth Etiquette now offers advice and coaching to individuals, families, and organizations to help them incorporate courteous life skills into everyday living, encompassing everything from manners to basic business and social etiquette to fine dining. Offering etiquette classes in Vancouver for people of all ages.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how she does it but Ms. Elizabeth has given me back my pleasant, respectful child. I will recommend Ms. Elizabeth\u2019s Etiquette class to all parents and would love to see her course brought into classrooms to teach all children and perhaps places of business; for in practicing the homework with our child, it reminded us adults of our manners as well.\n\n\u201cOur child is proud of her improvement, her new skills and enjoyed the time with Ms. Elizabeth. This was money well spent!\u201d\n~ Sincerely, Mrs. Darci Schmid\n\nDownload Free Table Etiquette Guide!\n\nTable manners involve more than just the way we eat, being observant and considerate of others is the essence of being a well-mannered diner.

Highly recommend you ask them for a quote.\n\n- Gord\n\nOur experience with the All-Craft team was excellent from day 1. Brian clearly outlined the schedule and process for our deck replacement project. The guys did a wonderful job from old deck removal, excavation for footings to construction of the new deck. It was clear throughout the process that the crew (Steve and Kyle did our deck) takes pride in their work and attention to detail. They were professional and accommodating to changes. We are so very pleased with our new deck.\n\n\u2013 William\n\nCommitment from start to finish. My initial meeting with Brian set the tone for what was truly a worry-free experience that would surpass our expectations. Jody provided details of how our deck project would unfold and then Jacob and Kyle followed through with the expert craftsmanship and care you just don\u2019t see anymore. Brian concluded with a final inspection. Fantastic team effort by everyone involved. Great communication, always on time, and quality work. I would highly recommend All-Craft to anyone.\n\n\u2013 D.Winter\n\nWe needed our back deck replaced and All-Craft gave us a good quote and we moved forward. They did our front deck a few years ago and we were very pleased with the quality of the work so we chose them to do this new project. We really trust them. The team was professional, always on time, left the space clean and tidy when they were done for the day and were very friendly. We would recommend them without hesitation. Thanks for everything.\n\n\u2013 Sylvana & Karl\n\nIn choosing products, All-Craft was wonderful at helping us balance quality and cost. When I set my heart on a beautiful high-end window design, they provided similar high quality custom window options at a significantly lower price.\n\n\u2013 Dan and Stella\n\nAll-Craft was the most professional/knowledgeable of the companies we contacted.

It just goes to show how many people pay attention to film in general and Charlie Kaufman in particular.\n\nOn September 12, Eva will be reading at the West End Phoenix headquarters\u00a0in west Toronto. You can find her there at 3 Bartlett Avenue. The doors open at 7:30 and the reading begins at eight.\n\nAnd if that\u2019s not enough, on\u00a013 September, Jackals & Fireflies will be showing in Toronto at the Paradise Cinema on Bloor. It\u2019s a short film based on one of Eva\u2019s poems and it\u2019s directed by Charlie Kaufman. Eva and Charlie will be on hand for a Q+A. The fun begins at 8pm and you can find tickets here: https://tinyurl.com/yhpz7z7c\n\nREAD MORE\n0 Comments\nNEWS, POETRY\nApril 8, 2023\nCandace de Taeye on the longlist for the Gerald Lampert Memorial Award!\nCANDACE DE TAEYE\nSPECIAL 20% OFF. \u00a0$18.00 IS NOW $14.40 \u00a0CAN/US\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s April, it\u2019s National Poetry Month, it\u2019s getting warmer, and the League of Canadian Poets will soon hand out their annual awards. There are a lot of great books here on the longlists, including Candace deTaeye\u2019s _Pronounced / Workable._ It is up for the Gerald Lampert Memorial Award and to celebrate we\u2019re going to lower the price of the book so everyone in the family can have one. One week only and it will be the first really warm sunny week of the year. What\u2019s not to like?\n\nYou can also hear her reading April 8th at an Artists in the Ambulance event. It\u2019s a benefit concert and silent auction in support of Wounded Warriors Canada. The live music and the art is provided by GTA paramedics. Who knew there were so many? It\u2019s at 3030 Dundas West and doors open at 7pm.\n\nREAD MORE\n0 Comments\nNEWS\nJanuary 19, 2023\nCorrado Paina sells out\n\nWell, not artistically at least. He will be presenting his new book, Changing Residence at the Italian Cultural Institute at 6:30 pm on January 19. Ticket reservations for this (free) event were gone the day they were posted but you never know, there may be some room left if they have any last minute cancellations. The Institute is at 496 Huron St. and the phone number is 416-921-3802 if you want to call them and try your luck. Even if you can\u2019t catch the reading you can still buy the book right here!\n\nREAD MORE\n0 Comments\nNEWS\nDecember 7, 2022\nLast Night at the Monarch Tavern\n\nSTEPHEN BROCKWELL READING FROM HIS LATEST BOOK, IMMUNE TO THE SACRED.\n\nLast night we launched six books at the Monarch Tavern and the place was packed. The writers all gave great readings and book sales were brisk. It was so gratifying to see so many people come out to support the writers and the press. For two hours it was like Covid never happened! Thank you everyone, let\u2019s do this again really soon.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nREAD MORE\n0 Comments\nNEWS\nDecember 4, 2022\nFishing off the company dock at Mansfield\n\nIt may seem like Mansfield is fishing off the company dock when the first notice of The Sleep Orchard, by Amy Dennis, is written by rob mclennan, who also has a book out with Mansfield this year. But this review\u00a0is really just a continuation of the work rob does all year long\u2014documenting the small press world and telling us all about it. Between interviewing writers and reviewing books, no other writer in the country comes close to matching rob\u2019s engagement with Canadian literature. Why wouldn\u2019t he also write about the first book by somebody as talented as Amy Dennis?\n\n\u00a0 His latest book, Essays in the Face of Uncertainties, came out of the enforced isolation that Covid brought to Canadians in 2020. In these very personal meditations, rob tries to make sense of the unfolding pandemic in the quiet company of his wife and two daughters. As the country goes into lockdown, rob naturally turns to his library and brings writers from around the world into his narrative. His wide reading allows him to bring a larger conversation into his family\u2019s isolation, and then share it with readers of this book. He shows us how ideas and books bring us together, even as circumstances force us apart.\n\n\u00a0That isolation is captured beautifully in the cover photo of these essays. You see the love of a family at play, even as they look out to the world from the home that Covid turned into an aquarium. That photo was taken by Stephen Brockwell, whose book Immune to the Sacred was also published this year by Mansfield.\n\nThe poetry world in Canada is small and the company dock is necessarily large but there is an incredible diversity of talent represented here that cannot be diminished by proximity. Because rob mclennan writes about everyone, he naturally wrote about the latest book by Stephen Brockwell,\u00a0where he highlights the almost scientifically rigorous observation of poems that are also lyrical and deeply human. Stephen\u2019s book should be read in full because he is a senior writer at the top of his game, but rob\u2019s review can be a useful introduction if you are not familiar with Stephen\u2019s work. If nothing else, a visit to the review page will also give you an opportunity to see rob mclennan looking quite masculine in his skirt. That has to be worth a click.\n\nREAD MORE\n0 Comments\nLATEST RELEASES\n\nFOLLOW @MANSFIELDPRESS ON TWITTER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMANSFIELD PRESS\n25 Mansfield Ave.\nToronto, Ontario\nM6J 2A9\nCanada\n\n416.532.2086\n\ninfo@mansfieldpress.net\n\nMansfield Press \u00a9 2025.

It seems a bit pricey but I've tried looking for personalized name tags elsewhere and it was just about the same price or even more expensive. You can customize it however you want and I love how it came out. Doesn't look like those cheap name tags you find elsewhere. \u201d\nLaura\nGood quality and look\n\u201cName tags look good and professional. Magnets are strong. Like the fact that no more holes in my clothing.\u201d\nBluehiker\nLooks great!\n\u201cWe use these nametags for hotel employees, the ability to create a nametag on site makes hiring people easier and with turn around being high right now it's nice that you can recycle these, just remove the printed name and create another insert.
