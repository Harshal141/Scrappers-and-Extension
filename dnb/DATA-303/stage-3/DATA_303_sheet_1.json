We’re looking to set the example, but it’s only by working together that the aluminum can industry can achieve true circularity.\n\nAs an industry, we must work together to:\nImprove Recycling Rates\nIncrease Recycled Content\nDesign for Circularity\nSupport Policy Change\nThe power of CAN.\n\nTo reach our 2030 sustainability goals, we must first achieve circularity – the continued lifecycle of reusable materials – in our local communities and across the globe. Together with our customers and partners, we are focusing our efforts on these four areas:\n\nLearn About Our 2030 Initiatives\nCollection\n\nLet’s make deposit return systems more convenient and readily available. Together, we can reach a recovery target of 90% for all beverage containers globally.\n\nSorting\n\nBarriers for investments in material recovery facilities and sorting technology delay progress. Combining product design guidelines and the right tipping fees and material bans can bring the change we need for sorting innovation.\n\nRecycling\n\nIncreasing local recycling efforts reduces imports of virgin raw materials. By increasing recycling efforts and ensuring technologies are able to produce maximum yields and quality, the global footprint for new aluminum production can be drastically lowered.\n\nRecycled Content\n\nWe want to ensure that recycled content gets used as best it can. This can be supported by creating a standard for recycled content, providing incentives to keep packaging-to-packaging loops closed and by offering tax incentives for recycled materials versus virgin.\n\nLearn More About Our Values\n\nWe build a culture of excellence where our people are empowered to work together to find lasting, circular solutions that grow value for our business, our customers, our shareholders and the world.\n\nWe believe in the strength of our people, the integrity of our culture, and our ability to consistently deliver value, driving us to make this vision a reality.\n\nWe attune to our customers’ needs by actively listening, taking on their challenges as our own as we create long-term solutions with cascading sustainability benefits beyond their business.\n\nWe build a culture of excellence where our people are empowered to work together to find lasting, circular solutions that grow value for our business, our customers, our shareholders and the world.\n\nWe believe in the strength of our people, the integrity of our culture, and our ability to consistently deliver value, driving us to make this vision a reality.\n\nWe attune to our customers’ needs by actively listening, taking on their challenges as our own as we create long-term solutions with cascading sustainability benefits beyond their business.\n\nWe build a culture of excellence where our people are empowered to work together to find lasting, circular solutions that grow value for our business, our customers, our shareholders and the world.\n\nWe believe in the strength of our people, the integrity of our culture, and our ability to consistently deliver value, driving us to make this vision a reality.\n\nWe attune to our customers’ needs by actively listening, taking on their challenges as our own as we create long-term solutions with cascading sustainability benefits beyond their business.\n\nCAREERS WITH BALL\nBe unstoppable.\n\nWe believe our packaging can change the world — and you can too.

With the abundance of opportunities to grow and learn, I am encouraged to be ambitious with my career and to seek advancement opportunities. At Newell, I am constantly inspired to be a better teammate, to lead with integrity and to aspire for greater because that’s what I see in everyone around me.\n\nDana Paulita Harmond\n\nMANAGER, CORPORATE STRATEGY\n\nNewell Brands provided the jumpstart to a much-needed change in my career at a pivotal time in my life and has provided many new opportunities for me since then. People are the essential part of why I love working at Newell and they also are the center of my work. Ensuring the overall health and safety of our employees around the globe is my top priority. By nature, people all have the same aspiration no matter where they’re located, especially when it comes to safety - everyone wants safety for themselves and their families. The diversity of people, positions and functions, and countries Newell operates in gives you a glimpse into the tapestry of this incredible work family.\n\nThierry Gendre\n\nSAFETY DIRECTOR, EMEA & APAC\n\nI joined Newell Brands in 2009 and immediately noticed that it was different than any company that I’d worked at before. This company was completely invested in the growth and success of one of its best assets - the employees.

What I love the most about working here is that Newell allows high performers to achieve their career goals and passion for winning is a core value. I enjoy collaborating across different countries and regions.

I also love that Newell gives people opportunities to volunteer on employee and community committees. People at Newell are friendly, and we engage positively with one another throughout the workday. Our teams in the factory work great together. It is inspiring to work for a company that motivates teams to work hard and feel appreciated.\n\nDavid Sexton\n\nCOUNTER CYCLE, INVENTORY CONTROL\n\nAfter being employed in the gaming industry for several years, I looked to make a career change in hopes of expanding my knowledge of corporate design. I was hired by Newell Brands for a three-month contract position to cover an employee out on leave. You could say things have gone well – I’m now going on almost ten years here! Our culture is different at Newell Brands. We’re given the chance to succeed. Opportunities to take ownership and present ideas are limitless, which makes working here extremely rewarding.\n\nFiona Johnson\n\nMANAGER, CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS DESIGN\n\nMy work at Newell Brands has enabled me to grow my specialized design skills and further my leadership abilities over the past 11 years.

From its roots in the early stages of the plastics polymer modification industry a half century ago, PMC has branched out through start-ups and strategic acquisitions to dominate select markets in plastics/chemicals, manufacturing, food service, packaging and finance. PMC and its subsidiaries employ more than 3,500 worldwide.\n\nhistory\n\nPhilip Kamins began his career in the plastics industry in the early 1950’s. In the 1960’s he began to invest in plastics manufacturing facilities. Within a few years, the acquisition of plastics companies multiplied and in 1974 the Plastics Management Corp. was established. Now known as PMC Global, Inc, its primary function is to manage and support investments across a wide range of industries. Mr. Kamins’ outlook for the future includes internal growth and expansion through acquisitions, both domestic and international. Mr. Kamins just welcomed the third generation into the business and is excited to see the business continue to allow family involvement.\n\nphilosophy\n\n“The freedom to succeed, the support to grow” PMC Global’s start-ups and acquisitions encompass a diverse range of industries, markets, customers and cultures and embrace a wide variety of business and management styles. We encourage the sharing and leveraging of ideas, resources and technologies across our entire portfolio. Our decentralized management philosophy allows each subsidiary under the PMC Global umbrella to maintain a strong individual identity with enormous flexibility and the freedom to succeed through local decision making. At the same time, PMC Global stands at the ready to provide each business growth-oriented support in the form of capital investments; administrative, legal and financial guidance, and access to worldwide business and market intelligence.\n\noperations\n\nPMC Global’s North American operations are managed by PMC, Inc. Group. Our European manufacturing operations are managed by PLIC (PMC Leaders in Chemicals) and we maintain a strong presence in Asia via PMC Science-Tech Industries (Nanjing) Co. Ltd.  All three subsidiaries are independently managed by seasoned professionals boasting extensive knowledge of their industries, local cultures and business climates.\n\nPMC COMPANIES\nRECENT NEWS\nA Brand New Take on the Classic 6×8″ Container\nMay 1, 2014\nPeople on the Move at KOMO Machine\nFebruary 19, 2014\nInteractive Design Application Shortens Time to Market\nFebruary 12, 2014\nINDUSTRIES\nChemical\nConstruction\nEnergy\nFinancial\nFood Service / Food\nHealth and Beauty\nMachinery / Fabricating\nPackaging\nPharmaceutical\nPlastics\nPMC SITE SEARCH\nPMC GLOBAL, INC.\n\n12243 Branford Street\nSun Valley, CA 91352\nTel: (818) 896-1101\nFax: (818) 897-0180\n\n© 2014 PMC Global Inc.

I was leaving for a work trip the next morning, so I had already packed the car in expectation to leave for my early flight. The storm hit and in addition to losing power, the accumulation of ice on the trees combined with high winds caused one of my neighbor's trees to fall directly on my SUV in the middle of the night.\n\nREAD MORE \n\nCrushproof and Crashproof\n\nI was on my way home from teaching a women’s “stop the bleed” and firearms safety course at the Homestead (Florida) training center for Triad medical training. I had my Pelican 1615 Air Case tied down in the bed of my truck with my range setup inside. I was at a stoplight when I heard two cars coming up behind me at a high rate of speed. I realized they were coming into my lane and not stopping. The lead car struck the rear of my truck spinning me into the intersection and ejecting my Pelican Case from the bed of my truck. My Pelican Case ended up in the middle of the intersection and got dragged under a pickup truck, until it got run over and became dislodged. The gentleman who’s truck it was under noticed the case dislodge from under his truck and took it home. Upon inspection he found my fiancé’s business card in the ID slot and reached out, reuniting me with my gear!\n\nREAD MORE \n\nSocial\n\n     \n\nWhy Pelican?\n\nABOUT\nOUR STORY\nOUR VISION MISSION AND VALUES\nCAREERS\nPRESS RELEASES\nPELICAN IN THE NEWS\nCOMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT\nSUSTAINABILITY\nLEADERSHIP\nAFFILIATE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nSupport\n\nCONTACT US\nSUBMIT A WARRANTY CLAIM\nDEALER LOGIN\nGUARANTEE OF EXCELLENCE\nTECHNICAL BULLETINS\nCALIFORNIA SUPPLY CHAIN ACT\nBATTERY SAFETY\nRETURN POLICY\nONLINE STORE FAQ\nSHIPPING & HANDLING\nMILITARY DISCOUNT PROGRAM\nU.S. GOVT.

Built by one woman, Rose Blumkin, after she had raised four kids, Nebraska Furniture Mart grew into the largest furniture retailer in the country. Rose worked in her stores until she was 100 years old. Mrs. B, as they called her, is a legend in Nebraska and in American retailing.\n\n1950\nCharles Schneider Furniture\n\nOne of her daughters married Charles Schneider who started Charles Schneider Furniture to provide merchandise for Rose’s stores. But Charles soon realized furniture was going to need lots of this new polyurethane foam. So back in 1958, he started Future Foam.\n\n1958\nFuture Foam Begins\n\nSo back in 1958, he started Future Foam. Charles Schneider Furniture closed after over 70 years. But Future Foam now has over 30 plants making foam for car seats, marine upholstery, carpet underlay and especially furniture. Maybe the couch or chair you’ll sit on to watch TV tonight. That all began after incorporation on September 15th, 1958.\n\n1973\nFuture Foam Facility Openings > 1970’s\n\n1973 - Newton / 1977 - Middleton / 1978 - Oklahoma City / 1979 - Kansas City\n\n1980\nFuture Foam Facility Openings > 1980’s\n\nSpringfield, MO - 1981 / Fullerton, CA - 1982 / West Valley City, UT - 1985\n\n1990\nFuture Foam Facility Openings > 1990’s\n\nDenver, CO - 1991 / Foam Craft, CA - 1994 / Middleton, WI - 1994 / Omaha, NE - 1996 / Dallas, TX - 1998 / High Point, NC - 1998\n\n2000\nFuture Foam Facility Openings > 2000’s\n\nMinneapolis, MN - 2000 / Archdale, NC - 2001 / Oklahoma City, OK - 2004 / Fairless Hills, PA - 2007 / Orlando FL - 2007 / Dallas, TX - 2007 / Fullerton CA - 2009\n\n2010\nFuture Foam Facility Openings > 2010’s\n\nTracy, CA - 2011 / Mid North Industrial - 2013 / Archdale, NC - 2013 / Dallas, TX - 2013 / Middleton, WI - 2014 / Washabelle, LLC - 2015 / Neven Sleep LLC -2015 / Mansfield, MA - 2015 / Fullerton, CA -2016 / Auriga, LLC - 2016 / Future Foam Germany -2016 / Pacoima CA 2017\n\n2020\nFuture Foam Facility Openings > 2020’s\n\nAcquired plants in Tupelo, MS, Kent, WA , and Elkhart, IN in 2020 | Providence, RI and the Forma Line in Fullerton, CA was opened in 2020\n\nOur Focus on Sustainability\n\nLed by top talents who have spent their careers developing recycling processes, helping the environment is engrained in our culture and how we do business, not just a nice thing to do.\n\n2,445,706,523 lbs.\n\nPost-Industrial scrap from landfills diverted for re-use.\n\nContact Us\n\n1610 Avenue N\nCouncil Bluffs, Iowa 51501-1071\n\nPhone: 712.323.9122\nFax: 712.323.0158\nToll Free: 800.733.8061\nAbout  Facilities  Careers  Contact\n© 2025 Future Foam \n Do Not Sell My Personal Information  Privacy Policy  California Supply Chain Act  Transparency"

We have achieved our superior safety record through diligence, training and an overall safety-oriented approach to our processes. We keep our work environments optimized as we are compelled to our workers’ safety and development. With the market segments we service, our customers can count on us to provide products that meet or exceed their food grade requirements. Our social responsibility drives our success.\n\n9\n\t\nSERVICE\n\nWithout our customers, RediBagUSA would not exist. Our commitment to service is what allows us to retain customers for many years. We value these relationships and are always collaborating with our customers to reduce costs, waste and to drive more value in what they offer to their customers. We also source from multiple countries to ensure that supply chain continuity is maintained. We react quickly to the ever changing needs of the industries we serve, this adaptation is made possible by the close interaction we maintain with our customers and partners.\n\n9\n\t\nVALUE\nValue is a combination of both quality and competitive pricing. While we ensure that the quality of our products meet or exceed the expectations of our customers, we also are focused on providing these products at the most competitive prices. We select the best raw materials to fulfill the highest quality standards for our customers and for the environment. Why choose between sustainability and quality when you can have both. Our focus on the specific needs of each industry we serve permits us to offer the most valuable products to our customers.\nRediBagUSA\nSUSTAINABILITY GOALS\nREDUCE PLASTIC WASTE\n\nOne of our focal points has been to identify ways to reduce plastic waste that ends up in a landfill or in our precious waterways. This is why we have been working on the following three approaches:\n\n \n\nREUSABLE BAGS\n\nWe have developed several low cost options to replace the single-use front end plastic shopping bags. This low cost but sturdy design makes it more affordable for the average consumer to utilize these bags.\n\n \n\nSAME PERFORMANCE, LESS PLASTIC\n\nBy switching some products to High Density poly, we can reduce the gauge of material needed to make the products. This has several benefits including less plastic used; lower cost to transport; and more bags per case. All of which have a positive impact on our environment.\n\n \n\nCOMPOSTABLE PLASTIC\n\nUsing PLA, a byproduct of corn starch, we can provide products that have the same performance as plastic but have a biodegradable characteristic that allows the product to decompose in landfills.\n\nREDUCE CARBON FOOTPRINT\n\nWe continually strive to work with plants that have eco-friendly production practices. Those practices include:  \n\n \n\nRECYCLING\n\nRobust recycling/reuse programs are a key component when considering partnering with a facility.\n\n \n\nRENEWABLE, EFFICIENT ENERGY\n\nWe have several facilities that are currently using hydroelectric and wind energy to power up their plants. Where these technologies are not available, we also work with our plants to ensure they are using energy efficient equipment when producing plastic goods.\n\n \n\nREDI BAG USA\n\nWe have executed energy saving initiatives such as LED light replacement in our warehouses. Our work environments are eco-friendly and energy efficient, we are always improving our sustainability standards.\n\nGlobal presence in over 20 countries\n\nPounds produced in 2019\n\nYears of experience\nProudly serving\nour valued customers\nContact us for more information\nSolutions\nFood service\nGrocery\nIndustrial\nMedical\nRetail\nQuick links\nCompany\nProducts\nContact Info\n\n\t\nHeadquarters\n135 Fulton Ave, New Hyde Park NY 11040\n}\n\t\nOpen Office Hours\nMonday – Friday\n8:00AM – 6:30PM\nSaturday\n8:00AM – 12:00PM\nv\n\t\nOur Numbers\n\nNew York Headquarters\n(516) 746-0600\nOhio Office\n(330) 568-4200\n\nCopyright © 2020 New York Packaging & RediBagUSA All Rights Reserved."

A series of droughts resulted in increased water-use restrictions, which led California wineries to look for ways to treat and reuse wastewater. A Napa winery found the perfect match for their sustainability goals with customized Xerxes® tanks, with the added benefit of the complete corrosion resistance needed for the chemicals and varied pH levels contained in winery wastewater. From the first year of operation, it paid off, with the winery treating and reusing 1.35 million gallons of water – the amount of water they would have had to source from somewhere else. In the words of the winery manager: “Our water now has two life cycles.” That’s a success by all measures.\n\nHydroChain Vortex Filter is NJDEP certified\n\nOur Vortex Filter has been laboratory verified for removal of pollutants to standards set by the New Jersey Corporation of Advanced Technology (NJCAT).\n\nStormwater chambers add value for fuel customers\n\nWhen planning their new stores, our long-time convenience store and retail fuel customers can now find what they need for stormwater management with with our new HydroChain™ products.\n\nNew team members needed at our facilities\n\nWe have openings at all our North American manufacturing facilities.

These single injection molded products were developed utilizing patent pending designs that will provide the safety and efficiency the industry deserves. With the TuffStand you will:\n\nSave Time, Labor & Freight Costs\nIncrease Safety\nOut-Perform traditional wood support Systems\n2021 FINALIST! Pipeline & Gas Journal\nBest Repair Technology Advancement\nGET A QUOTE\nTUFFSTAND MODELS\n12\" TUFFSTAND: TS12-ST TN\n\nThe DuraPlas 12″ TuffStand is designed to be the strongest, safest, and most durable 12″ pipe stand in the oil and gas industry. Utilizing a wide square base and angled side walls, the 12″ TuffStand can withstand the extreme conditions of any pipeline job using 2-12″ pipe. When developing this pipe stand, our goal was to create the absolute best product that provides the safety and efficiency the industry deserves. By replacing a pile of wood skids with the 12″ TuffStand, you are able to increase job efficiency and cut down on the labor costs associated with hauling and moving wood skids. And while wood skids are heavy and often cracked, wet, and rotten, our 12″ TuffStand weighs just 28.5lbs and is made with a high-density polyethylene resin. Make the switch and start using the 12″ TuffStand today!\n\n24” TUFFSTAND: TS24-ST BK\n\nThe 24” TuffStand is capable of handling up to 24” pipe diameters and has set the bar as the new industry standard. As the only pipe stand in the industry manufactured with Super-Tough Nylon Resin, the 24” TuffStand supported over 75,000 lbs* in a controlled testing facility! The first-of-its-kind design and top grade Super-Tough Nylon allow our 24″ TuffStand to carry a workload 3X more than any other plastic 24″ stand.\n\nWith the 24” TuffStand, you can tackle larger pipe projects while saving money on freight, labor, and time.\n\n*Tests were completed in a controlled environment on flat surfaces under perfect conditions. *Do not exceed maximum load limit of 10,500 lbs.\n\nSpecs\nREQUEST CATALOG\n/////////////////////\nTechnical Specifications\nModel\tBase\tTop\tSaddle\tWeight\tStands / Pallets\nTS12-ST TN\n(12\" TuffStand)\t25\" x 25\"\n63.5cm x 63.5cm\t16\" x 16\"\n40.64cm x 40.64cm\t3\" Deep\n7.62cm Deep\t28.5 lbs\n12.93 kg\t52\nTS24-ST BK\n(24\" TuffStand)\t40\" Diameter\n101.6cm Diameter\t29\" x 19\"\n73.66cm x 48.26cm\t4.25\" Deep\n10.8cm Deep\t33.5 lbs\n15.2 kg\t12\nPro Tips\n\nThe experts at DuraPlas have put together some Pro Tips to help improve\nyour operation and get the most out of your equipment.\n\n/////////////////////\n \nLet Us Introduce the TuffStand\n \nFeatures of the 12-Inch TuffStand\n \nFeatures of the 24-Inch TuffStand\n \n12-Inch TuffStand and Using Skids\n \n24-Inch TuffStand and Using Skids\n \nHow to Inspect TuffStands for Reuse\n \nTuffStand: Spotting Cracks Prior to Restacking\n \nTuffStand: Base Not Fully Engaged with Ground\n \nHow Heat and Sunlight Affect the TuffStand\n \nSpacing TuffStands on a Rise\n \n12\" TuffStand - Flat Surface\n \n12\" TuffStand - Uneven Surfaces\n \n24\" TuffStand - Flat Surface Tests\n \n24\" TuffStand - Skid Tests\n \n24\" TuffStand - Flat Surface Tests\n \n12\" TuffStand - Product Overview\n \n24\" TuffStand - Product Overview\nMedia Gallery\n\nOfficial product images and the “in the field” photography.\n\n\n\n/////////////////////\nResources\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (PDF)\nREQUEST CATALOG\n12\" TuffStand: Use Instructions\n\nIMPORTANT: Failure to follow these instructions can result in serious injuries or damages to the TuffStands.\n\nReplace product if any physical defects are present such as cracking or discoloration. These stands are designed to absorb the weight of the pipe and give under an extreme load rather than crack. After the weight is removed, the pipe stand should regain its normal shape. Stands should be replaced if there is visible discoloration or cracking.\n\nLoad Limit: 3,500 lbs (1,588 kg)\n\nAlthough our 12″ (30.5 cm) TuffStand was lab tested and held over 20,000 lbs (9,072 kg), the stands should never be overloaded. There are many factors involved on the job site that cannot be replicated in a controlled testing environment.\n\n*The 12” TuffStand product is only rated for up to 3,500 lbs (1,588 kg)\n\nSuggested Spacing: Up to 40 Linear Feet (12.2 Meters)\n\nThe 12” TuffStand was designed and tested to handle “quad” lengths which is +/- 80 linear feet (24.4 m), however we still suggest a maximum of 40 feet (12.2 m) between spacings for overall safety.\n\n*Ultimate spacing should be determined using pipe weight and should never exceed 3,500 lbs (1,588 kg))\n\nDo Not Use TuffStand on Bends\n\nThe TuffStand should not be used within a bend. Stands are acceptable for use before and after a bend.\n\nUse Only on Level Surfaces or Place Two (2) Wood Skids Underneath Pipe Stand\n\nWhen working on uneven ground, the chances of the stand tipping over increases. Level the right-of-way or place the stand on two (2) evenly spaced wood skids.\n\nThe base of the stand should not be placed on large rocks or sharp objects. The base should be in full contact with the ground.\n\nThe maximum slope for the stand is not to exceed 10 degrees.\n\n*Suggested: Skids run perpendicular to the pipe\n\nDouble-up TuffStands When Hydrotesting\n\nWhen hydrotesting, the water adds much more weight to the product. Hydrotesting is not recommended on the stands but in the event it needs to be done for bore sections, etc., it is necessary to utilize a 20 linear foot (6.1 m) spacing.\n\nPlace Skids/Crotch Every 7 to 10 TuffStands\n\nRecommended to place a crotch every 7-10 stands to ensure the line does not tip over during handling/construction or in expansion / contraction that occurs with temperature changes. Skid sections should be a minimum of 6 skids in height to achieve 24″ (61 cm).\n\nOn a Hill or Overbend, Use Two (2) TuffStands\n\nWhen placing a stand on top of an overbend/hill, the weight and force of the pipe is doubled. Disperse the weight by placing two (2) stands on either side of the top of the hill.\n\nDo Not Stack Tuffstands to Gain Elevation\n\nIn order to gain elevation, place a few skids underneath and/or build a flat “platform” for a single stand to sit on top. When adding the weight of the pipe to a stack of stands, the stands will nest very tightly and will be difficult to separate.\n\nCover/Tarp When Not in Use\n\nAlthough our stands have UV protection, it is recommended to further protect the stands from sun damage which can cause the plastic to breakdown and weaken over time. To get the most out of our TuffStands, cover them when not in use.\n\n24\" TuffStand: Use Instructions\n\nIMPORTANT: Failure to follow these instructions can result in serious injuries or damages to the TuffStands.\n\nReplace product if any physical defects are present such as cracking or discoloration.

Since 2018, we have been investing exclusively out of our affiliate Right Lane Industries LLC, an industrial holding company offering a stable home to lower middle market industrial businesses that have been orphaned inside larger companies, or that are undergoing a period of underperformance for which prior ownership or their creditors are not capable of addressing.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur transactions - which often involve a heightened level of complexity - are designed to provide attractive solutions to sellers, whether they are large corporates seeking to divest a non-core division, or the owners and creditors of an underperforming business seeking liquidity or recovery. At the same time, we seek to create a stable and prudently capitalized environment from which our companies can grow into world class, competitive organizations. Our companies are operated by autonomous management teams who are heavily aligned with Right Lane, and who share significantly in the wealth creation of our investments.\n\n\nCopyright © Right Lane Capital LLC.

(PSI), collaborating with Polkinghorn Group Architects and Lott Brother’s Construction, undertook an extensive renovation of the public access areas in St. David’s Medical Center North Austin.\nSee project\nParkland Hospital\nFor Matt Jones, operations director for Balfour Beatty Construction, building the new $1.3 billion Parkland Hospital in Dallas posed numerous challenges.\nSee project\nCanadian Valley Tech Center\nThe Canadian Valley Technology Center, located in El Reno, Oklahoma, is a school committed to providing students with a high-tech education in support of personal and professional development in the technology field.\nSee project\nIndustry leaders trust PSI\nGayla Lutts, Ed.D.\nSuperintendent/CEO, Canadian Valley Technology Center\n\nPanel Specialists, Inc. (PSI) worked with our architect, MA+, in 2012 to design and install a wall panel system in our Health Careers building at our Chickasha campus. The panel system has held up well since the building was reopened during the 2014-15 school year. It is easy to maintain and we have had no maintenance issues or other concerns. Additionally, the panels have been an attractive addition to the building; they brighten up the lobby area making it inviting and vibrant!\n\nStephanie Laughlin, RID, IIDA\nSr. Project Interior Designer\n\nWe recently used PSI wall panel systems for the first time last summer. Several of our residence halls are over 50 years old and it shows. We used the panel system to cover up the old walls in the entire Lobby of Wall Gates. It completely transformed the lobby and it looks brand new! It is a very durable, easy to clean, cost effective wall treatment. I like that you can create your own designs by using different laminates and tackable surfaces. They sent out representatives to measure and help out with the logistics of this large renovation. The panels come pre-cut and numbered so the installation will go smoothly. They are also available for questions or situations that may arise. We appreciate your help and expertise!\n\nRandy Salsman\nSenior Construction Project Manager, Facilities Maintenance, University of North Texas\n\nWe have recently renovated our 60+ year old Physics Building and utilized the PSI wall panel system to overlay the existing tile wainscoting on the first-floor hallways. It dramatically transformed the building's interior with\namazing results. The quality and workmanship of the PSI panel system are exceptional. We installed this system in\none of our heavily used conference rooms 8 years ago and it still looks as good as when it was first installed. PSI Wall Systems is an excellent product which will serve you well for years to come.\n\nChris Harren\nAustin Commercial, LP, Methodist Sugar Land Hospital\n\nPSI has been easy to work with both in the field and in the office. Deliveries and installations were on time\nleading to a successful completion of their scope of work and the project in general.\n\nDuane Martin\nDirector of A/E Services, Hendrick Medical Center\n\nHendrick Medical Center has been using PSI’s laminate wainscot panels for the last 13 years. In an effort to provide finishes that could withstand a lot of abuse, cut down on maintenance costs and provide a nice look, we implemented laminate wainscot panels in all patient rooms. This has proven to be so beneficial that we have pushed this concept out to exam rooms and waiting rooms in many of our locations. In my opinion, that one finish upgrade has been one of our best decisions. The enhanced appearance, along with the extended life of our room finishes, gives our customers a great impression while also saving us money on maintenance. We have implemented this concept in areas that are the most difficult to keep looking good on a day-to-day basis. We are very proud of our “look” and PSI laminate wainscot panels are a big part of our success.\n\nLatest news + blog\nView all\nOctober 7, 2024\nThe Versatile World of Laminates: Seamless Design, Built to Last!\nLearn more\nMay 17, 2024\nOn the Frontlines of Safety\nLearn more\nJanuary 10, 2024\nPanel Specialists, Inc….

The precision of our cutting is within .010″ and multiple sheets can be stacked and cut to size simultaneously.\n\nLearn More\n\nPlastic Drilling and Machining\n\nIn addition to other plastic fabrication services, Acrilex offers plastic drilling and machining of parts from various stock plastic sheets. Despite our automation, many operations are still performed by skilled craftsmen on our Bridgeport milling and machining centers, stationary drill presses, hand routing stations, and hand routing & drilling stations.\n\nLearn More\n\nLaser Cutting of Plastic\n\nAcrilex provides laser cutting of plastic and finished acrylic parts right off the laser machine! Laser cutters are outstanding for making fine detail, sharp corners, and smooth polished edges – all with the greatest accuracy. Lasers cut with speed and efficiency. Narrow kerf and close nesting of parts allows maximum yield per sheet to minimize cost, and polished edges eliminate the need for additional labor for proper aesthetics. \n\nLearn More\n\nAcrylic Edge Polishing and Finishing\n\nHigh capacity diamond edge polishing and finishing machines remove saw cut or routed edges and impart either a matte or high polished finish. Utilizing diamond equipment for acrylic edge polishing eliminates stress at the edges of parts which can lead to crazing down the road. Our equipment handles stacks of material and polishes many surfaces at once, making high quality polishing fast and economical. Hand Sanding, buffing, and flame polishing methods are also utilized for complex or curved edges and to reduce cost where the quality of diamond polishing is not required. \n\nLearn More\n\nCNC Routing Plastic\n\nCNC Routing plastic fabrication (Computer Numeric Controlled) components is an excellent method for producing high volumes of precision cut, complex plastic parts with repeatability, speed and accuracy. Acrilex has continuously upgraded its CNC routing capabilities with investments in the latest state of the art machinery. Acrilex’s behemoths can rout parts or panels up to 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each machine is equipped with four router heads that can reset their positions on the fly and shuttle between twin tables, and each head is equipped with a 8 bit tool changer.\n\nLearn More\n\nCut to Size Acrylic Sheets and Parts\n\nWith a variety of CNC panel saws, table saws, and vertical panel saws, Acrilex can cut to size acrylic sheets and parts in small or large quantities.

As a global supplier of precision fabricated thermal and acoustical materials, Concote manufactures and distributes foam, fiberglass, plastics and adhesives with an eye towards maximizing efficiency, performance and durability.\n\nSpectape\n\nSpectape is a distributorship, reselling and converting industrial packaging tapes, packaging materials and other specialty items predominantly involving pressure sensitive adhesive systems.\n\nOfficial Website\n\nInsul-Fab\n\nInsul-Fab is a manufacturer and converter of foam goods, rubber products, fiberglass, plastics, adhesives and other composite materials which serve primarily as acoustic, thermal and electrical barriers and insulators. All of Insul-Fab’s products are made to customer-specification.\n\nOfficial Website\n\nConcote Corporation Overview - Featured Video\n\nVideo Details: Shelby Ricketts, President and CEO of Concote Corporation, describes Concote's business operations.\n\nVIDEO PAGE\n\nConcote Updates\nConcote Corporation Latest News\n\nMay 1, 2023\nESS vs BESS: What’s the Difference?\n\nYou can’t pick up an electrification industry trade magazine lately without reading about new developments in the field of energy storage. The technology offers numerous benefits… It can smooth demands on the local electrical grid, negate concerns with solar/wind energy fluctuations, lower costs to end-users by avoiding peak-rate surcharges, harness the outputs of multiple sources of renewable energy, provide backup capabilities for critical infrastructure (i.e. hospitals), delay local Governments needing to invest in costly grid improvements, and more.\n\nOften, the acronyms ESS and BESS seem to be used interchangeably. Both refer to Energy Storage Systems, which are used to store and release energy, but there is a difference between the two.\n\nESS stands for \"Energy Storage System.\" It is a broad term used to describe any system that stores energy for later use. This includes CHEMICAL (i.e. biofuels, hydrogen), ELECTROCHEMICAL (i.e. Batteries, Fuel Cells), ELECTROMAGNETIC (i.e. Inductors, Superconducting Magnets), THERMAL (i.e. latent heat), MECHANICAL (i.e. compressed air, flywheels), HYDRAULIC (i.e. pumped hydro storage, pressurized fluids) and HYBRID (i.e. battery-to-fuel cell) systems.\n\nBESS stands for \"Battery Energy Storage System.\" Because batteries store electric energy as chemical energy (then convert it back to an electrical form when needed), it is a type of ELECTROCHEMICAL ESS. As such, BESS is only one of many sub-categories of the broad \"Energy Storage System” (ESS) framework.\n\nJune 1, 2022\nConcote Moves Up on The Dallas Business Journal’s List\n\nConcote Corporation, doing business as InsulFab and Spectape, is pleased to have once again been included on the Dallas Business Journal’s List of Top North Texas Manufacturing Companies, ranked by total local employment. Concote made the list at #10, up from its previous ranking of #18 from 2021. The Dallas Business Journal compiles a variety of business lists that appear in the Business Journal’s weekly edition and annual Book of Lists. Over the course of the prior two years, the North Texas Manufacturing List has included several of Concote’s Customers, such as Lockheed Martin, Envision Dallas, and Raytheon, as well as other large-scale regional manufacturers, including General Motors Arlington Assembly, Trinity Industries, and Bell Helicopter. With an overall North American workforce of approximately 200, Concote continues to grow remain a premier converter and fabricator of engineered materials for a variety of original equipment manufacturers.\n\nMay 6, 2022\nRogers Corporation Hosts InsulFab as Part of Its Preferred Converter Summit\n\nRogers Corporation, makers of silicone under the trade names Poron and Bisco, recently hosted its Preferred Converters Conference in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania during the first week of May. Although many companies fabricate and convert Rogers Engineered Materials, Preferred Converters maintain high standards of quality, technical capability and customer service ensuring the best possible experience for end-users. The three day educational summit focused heavily on electrification of vehicles and equipment. Significant investment is being made by Rogers and its Preferred Converters, like InsulFab, to meet the design challenges presented by Electric Vehicle battery packs, as well as those of the Electric Vehicle chargin and supply equipment.\n\n<\nApril 4, 2022\nInsulFab May or May Not Have Fabricated Materials for the Jets Featured in Top Gun: Maverick\n\nDoes InsulFab fabricate materials that are installed in the new fighter jets featured in the Paramount’s upcoming film, Top Gun: Maverick, schedule for released in May 2022? According to Shelby Ricketts, an aerospace product manager, it’s classified. “We could tell you, but then we’d have to kill you.”\n\nIn the movie, Maverick’s new ride is a Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet and is a successor to the F/A-18 Hornet, with a 20% larger airframe, 33% more fuel capacity and 41% longer range. Top Gun: Maverick will also feature the F-35C, made by Lockheed Martin. The F-35C is the Navy’s aircraft carrier version of the Joint Strike Fighter, but with greater wing area, more robust landing gear and, of course, the requisite aircraft carrier landing hook.\n\nAs an AS 9100 aerospace and defense supplier to OEMs Boeing and Lockheed, InsulFab provides engineered insulation products that meet strict specifications for weight, flammability and density. High standards of quality, technical capability and regulatory compliance are not only expected, but demanded. As for whether or not InsulFab supplies materials for the fighter jets featured in Top Gun: Maverick, we prefer not to say.\n\nFor more Concote Corporation News click here to visit our News page.\n\nConcote’s mission is simple: to be a cutting edge, global fabricator and distributor of foams, insulation materials, plastics and adhesives.\n\nPopular Pages\nHome\nDoing Business\nResources\nVideos\nDFW Plant Headquarters\nAddress:\n600 Freeport Parkway, Suite 150\nCoppell, TX 75019 , United States\nPhone Number:\n(214) 956-0055\nToll Free:\n(800) 442-1338\nDirections and Shipping Hours\nAdditional Facilities\nInsul-Fab de Mexico:\nSanta Catarina, Nuevo Leon, Mexico \nOficina: 81 47 70 44 85\n© 2024 Concote Corporation.

It is tuned by carefully controlled heat treating. The longevity and dependability of Smith & Wesson products are due, in part, to our heat treating facilities and skills.\n\nControlling the physical properties of metal is achievable through various heat treating methods such as annealing, hardening and quenching.\n\nRead More\nPLATING & FINISHING\n\nMetal finishing operations — oxide coatings, plating, blasting and tumbling —can protect components from corrosion, enhance their function and make them more beautiful.

This latest video features Portco’s President and CEO, Kent Wall, the 3rd generation leader of the company that was started by his grandfather almost 90 years ago. Kent talks about what is at the core of the company, how innovative and responsive it can and has to be in this continually changing world. Let’s start a conversation.\n\nHow Custom Packaging Builds Your Brand in the Competitive Nut Market\nNov 29, 2024\nPackaging Solutions That Extend Shelf Life: Reducing Food Waste\nNov 26, 2024\nMeet Your Sustainability Goals with EarthGuard Compostable Packaging from Portco\nNov 19, 2024\nHow Flexible Packaging Saves Costs for Frozen Fruit Producers\nNov 7, 2024\nPackaging with Peace of Mind\n\nWe are a 3rd generation family run company. We strive to make the highest quality, safest packaging in the most responsible way – for brands, we’re really passionate about. We have a wide range of fiercely loyal clients because we stand behind every package we sell. One of the first west coast packaging companies to earn the highest level of SQF, the highest rating for food safety in our industry. We make multi-wall bags, stand-up pouches, and printed roll stock. We view our packaging as another ingredient – protecting your fresh, frozen, dry, and wet goods with the same standards of food safety as you do.\n\nOur plants are located on each side of Mt. Adams in the state of Washington. Our packaging appears on store aisles from Milwaukie to Melbourne.\n\nAssociations and Certifications\n\nAs we strive to maintain the highest level of safety and compliance in the flexible packaging industry, we are active members in several associations and the recipient of several important certifications that ensure safety and quality. Click here to explore. \n\nSustainability Options\n\nWhen it comes to packaging, consumers continue to demand more sustainable options and regulations continue to change. This trend will continue to influence buying decisions when choosing a product on the store shelf or e-commerce space.  To address these demands and support your brand, Portco Packaging™ has developed the EarthGuard™ line of options to address your company’s individual needs regarding sustainability. The EarthGuard™ line offers PCR Solutions, Recycle Ready, Compostable, and Bio-assimilated options. Explore EarthGuard here.\n\n \n\nWhat does a packaging mistake cost?\n\nA mistake or contamination in our industry costs way more than just a reprint of packaging – in ingredients, processing, time, delivery delays and retailer confidence.  One broken link in the food chain affects all others. So it was an easy decision to obtain the highest level of certification a food packaging can achieve with SQF. That’s peace of mind with your product and reputation on the line. It also reflects something else: we sweat the details. There’s a reason we’ve studied all pages of the SQF Food Safety Code for Manufacturing of Food Packaging and the SQF Quality Code…so you don’t have to. \n\nSQF is recognized by retailers and food service providers around the world who require a rigorous, credible food safety management system.\n\nRelentless Pursuit of a Better Way\n\nAt Portco, it's our mission to make the highest quality, safest flexible packaging in the most responsible way. We'll be the first to explore the way - ensuring the journey is safe and easy to follow.\n\nHighest Level SQF Certified\n\nGMI Certified Packaging Supplier\n\nRecent Popular Posts\n\nHow Custom Packaging Builds Your Brand in the Competitive Nut Market\nNov 29, 2024\nPackaging Solutions That Extend Shelf Life: Reducing Food Waste\nNov 26, 2024\nMeet Your Sustainability Goals with EarthGuard Compostable Packaging from Portco\nNov 19, 2024\n\nAdditional Links\n\nThe Portco Way\nProducts\nFacilities\nClients\nBlog\nCareers\nEarthGuard\nContact\n\nFollow Us"

I consider them a business partner, not a supplier. They are responsive in every way. They have never been late with a delivery, and their quality is outstanding. We are a global company with many suppliers, but I wouldn’t trust my business to anyone else.\n\nTony F.\nManufacturing Engineering Manager\n{\n\nPolymer’s sales, engineering, and commitment to quality truly impress me. Their team has displayed an unparalleled level of professionalism and expertise when reviewing and working to our specifications. My experience with Polymer has been nothing short of great. If you’re looking for a reliable partner for your injection molding needs, look no further. They are sure to exceed your expectations every step of the way. I am glad we elected to start working with them a few years ago.\n\nChris C.\nVice President of Operations and Technology\n{\n\nWe have worked with Polymer ever since our company was a startup developing a revolutionary medical aesthetic system.
