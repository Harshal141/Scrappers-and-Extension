Please select the correct icon below to direct your request to the right person. Please let us know if you prefer to speak to an Engineer or a person from sales.\n\nCombustion\n\nHybrid\n\nElectric\n\nSpecialty Products\n\nEnergy\n\nIndustrial\n\nFlexonics Medical\n\nHydrogen\n\nNecessity is the Mother of Invention\nInnovations are the Descendants.\n\nOne hundred years is a long time and Senior Flexonics has had many firsts during the past century. Flexonics was founded in the time when streets were lit with gas lamps. With the advent of the automobile, new drivers and their inevitable accidents not only gave rise to the auto insurance industry, but also the need for safer infrastructure. Streetlamps, needed for safe nighttime travel, had the unintended consequence of a catastrophic explosion when struck by a new driver. Necessity is the Mother of Invention. To solve this hazard Senior Flexonics created a flexible, stainless steel hose that would run through the gas light posts and shut off the gas line if the post was hit by a car. Explosions ceased. This innovation saved lives and property.\nFast forward a few decades, the space race was on. Wernher von Braun, the famous rocket scientist, needed durable metal bellows for the Saturn V rocket which was used for the Apollo space program. These giant expansion joints in the rocket booster, eight, ten or twelve feet in diameter, helped bring us to the moon and were designed, prototyped, validated and produced in the Senior Flexonics Bartlett facility.  This commitment to developing solutions continues today as new challenges present themselves.\n\nNecessity for a Cleaner Environment – Gas & Diesel Vehicles getting Cleaner and More Efficient\n\nSenior Flexonics developed a unique metal bellow to create leak-tight exhaust flex systems instead of the ball joint system, the standard practice at the time. This innovation took up the different motions/movements between the engine and the exhaust system while at the same time helping our customers keep a leak tight exhaust to meet emissions legislation.\n\nPrevious\nNext\n123456\n\nSOLUTIONS FOR ALL TYPES OF COMBUSTION ENGINES\n\nWhether it is a Diesel, Gasoline or Natural Gas Engine, our extensive range of products can be customized to your exact specifications.\n\nExhaust Gas Circulation (E.G.R.) and waste heat recovery for all types of combustion engines (Diesel, Natural Gas and Gasoline).\nFlexible metal bellow solutions to manage temperature and movement in all types of vehicles ranging from personal transport to on and off highway commercial vehicles.\nDiesel and gas fuel delivery systems including common rail and liquid conveyance for all types of cooling requirements.\nTurbo Oil Feed and Drain Tubes.\n\nLearn More\n\nCommercial vehicles presented a different clean air challenge. While accounting for only 4% of the vehicles on the road, they were responsible for 25% of the emissions. Capturing the heat from wasted emissions and reintroducing this into the engine flow is one method to reduce that impact. Although well intended, earlier EGR Cooler designs were prone to various problems as metals were exposed to extreme temperature ranges and the inherent expansion and contraction.  To address this, Senior Flexonics engineers listened to our customers’ needs, and applied their thermal management and heat exchanger experience to develop a durable, million-mile Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) cooler that would not only reduce emissions, but drastically reduced our customer’s warranty claim burden.\n\nFrom these applied lessons in thermal management and heat recovery, we are now ready to address driver concerns about the reliability, efficiency and range of electric vehicles – How far can I drive before I must charge, and will there be a place to do so?\n\nNecessity for Electric Vehicle Improvements – Further and Faster\n\nThermal management in electric vehicles is critical in terms of performance, longevity, and safety. Electric vehicle batteries are susceptible to fluctuating temperatures caused by both internal and external factors and can become damaged or degraded if exposed to temperatures outside their optimal range. This is especially relevant when operating in extreme temperatures or during rapid charging. Senior Flexonics battery thermal management plates are designed to maintain temperatures, ensuring that safety, performance, and battery life are optimized.\n\nPrevious\nNext\n12\n\nHYBRID VEHICLE ADVANCEMENTS\n\nOur extensive thermal management experience with both I.C.E and electric products uniquely positions Senior Flexonics to serve these types of vehicles.\n\nBattery cooling plates for electric and hybrid vehicles to maintain critical temperature thresholds.\nHighly efficient inverter cooling technologies to protect IGBTs.\nWaste heat recovery solutions and heat retention to extend vehicle ranges.\nFlexible metal bellow solutions to manage temperature and movement in all types of vehicles ranging from personal transport to on and off highway heavy duty vehicles.\nTubes / pipes for all types of engine systems ranging from the transfer of gases to liquid conveyance for all types of cooling requirements.\nElectric motor and buffering cooling tubes/pipes.\n\nLearn More\n\nSenior Flexonics is always researching the best ways to keep electronics cool. The power inverter is one of the critical components in an electric vehicle. The inverter converts DC to AC when power is required to drive the electric motors and converts in the opposite direction during regenerative braking. The main component inside the inverter is the IGBT (insulated gate bipolar transistor), and it generates heat. An effective method of cooling the IGBT is through a liquid cooled heat sink. Our heat sink features our proprietary “Omega” fin design. It is available in both aluminum and copper depending upon our client’s specifications. These new EV chill plates enhance thermal performance without plugging because the unique shape creates more surface area than a typical straight fin, while still allowing the same sized particles to pass without plugging.\n\nPrevious\nNext\n123\n\nELECTRIC VEHICLE ADVANCEMENTS\n\nThermal management products for Electric Vehicles.\n\nBattery cooling plates to maintain critical temperature thresholds.\nHighly efficient heat sinks for the cooling of inverters to protect IGBTs.\nWaste heat recovery solutions to extend vehicle ranges.\nTubes / pipes for all types of cooling requirements.\n\nLearn More\n\n\n\nNecessity to Deliver Energy – Innovations to help deliver that power\n\nOperations utilizing turbines, fuel cells, solar and vacuum/semiconductors require complex assemblies. Our Engineering resources have knowledge of specialized high-temperature alloys and manufacturing processes that require forming, welding, brazing, soldering, bending and machining of these materials. For our power generation customers, we manufacture custom heat exchangers, flexible metal tubing and hose, fuel nozzle bellows and recuperators.\n\nOur stationary Fuel Cells (SOFC and PEM) and Battery Farm component advancements have found applications for cloud-based data centers. As they are usually located in remote areas many rely on generating their own electricity through fuel cell technologies or battery farms. Fuel cells and battery farms all require consistent temperatures to prevent thermal loading. The utilization of heat exchangers to maintain the proper temperature range.\n\nPrevious\nNext\n123\n\nENERGY SOLUTIONS\n\nWe support many different energy technologies that require components customized to exact specifications.\n\nNuclear\nElectric\nSolar\nFuel Cell – Stainless Steel sub-assemblies and heat exchangers.\nVacuum/semiconductors.\nUtilities – Vacuum Interrupters, Vacuum Breakers for fault detection.\n\nLearn More\n\n\n\nNecessity to Stay Ahead – Innovations to meet industry challenges\n\nOil and Gas I Chemical Processing I Petrochemical and Refining I Heat Exchangers I Power Generation I Medical/Pharmaceutical I Electronics\n\nIndustrial markets all have requirements to meet the challenges set before them. For decades, we have continually invented new products to meet each of their specific and unique constraints. To support the development of these innovations we offer extensive analytical testing capabilities as well as rapid prototyping. These innovations are then validated against physical testing and computer modelling to predict the product’s lifecycle. Once accepted and green lighted for production, our high and low volume manufacturing abilities kick in to produce a wide range of products such as complex bellow assemblies that require forming and high precision machining. Our thermal management experience with Heat Exchangers is yet another example of our capabilities that span across a variety of industrial markets as detailed below.\n\nINDUSTRY – COMPLEX BELLOWS SUB-ASSEMBLIES\nDEFENSE / MILITARY, FOOD & BEVERAGE, FUEL CELLS, HVAC / R, INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL, OIL & GAS, UTILITIES\nPrevious\nNext\n1234\n\nOur metal bellows, thin walled expansion joints and tubing products can be customized to your market specifications.

To support upstream industries, we manufacture precision components for valves, cages and Gas Lift Bellows. Downstream activities supporting refinement / processing include specialized expansion joints and on-site services to maintain production in emergency situations such as Clam Shell repairs of bellows elements. These can often be done online, helping a facility avoid a costly shut down.\n\nChemical Processing\nAs a world leader in the design of Catofin expansion joints, Senior Flexonics continues to develop processes while working closely with licensors and customers to identify needs. These expansion joints must work under the stress of incredible heat, movement and velocity, and have the capability for advance warnings for security.\nLeak detection is paramount in plant piping and sometimes measurement gauges are not accessible or readily visible. Senior Flexonics “Red Tops” detect leaks in sections of piping without having the control panel in sight. This keeps the plant “online” and secure with numerous check points available.\n\nPetrochemical and Refining\nEquipment can be maintained by the Senior Flexonics team through on-site services such as surveys or emergency repair. By partnering with these companies and sharing records and reports, an outside eye can be invaluable in finding gaps and introducing efficiencies to implement. Whether in expansion joint inspection, petrochemical installation, or existing equipment repair.\n\nMedical/Pharmaceutical/Food and Beverage\nMedical devices demand strict manufacturing protocols for cleanliness. These complex assemblies vary greatly and may require specialized processes in their manufacture such as the union of dissimilar materials (Inconel to ceramic). Senior Flexonics has a long-established reputation for excellence producing these advanced components for life saving equipment that includes: blood heat exchangers, adult/infant oxygenator bellows, coronary / whole-body perfusion heat exchangers, and cryosurgical ablation probes. In the pharmaceutical industry we provide process heat exchangers, expansion joints and sub-assemblies to many well-known companies that produce various caplets, tablets, and liquid formulations.\n\nElectronics\nInnovations in electronics such as vacuum capacitors are used in high voltage applications. This variable capacitor is used for many purposes that require tuning, such as matching a network in the fabrication of semiconductor chips and flat panel displays. This unique design uses a high vacuum as its dielectric instead of air or non-conductive materials. Some of the most common applications are antenna couplings, semiconductor wafer fabrication, RF matching circuits, Pulse shaping circuits, Power amplifier tank circuits, and Non-magnetic circuits for MRI. Benefits of their use include long life and high reliability contained within a smaller package size and lower weight.\n\nNecessity of Hydrogen Eco-Systems\n\nMany economic, demographic, social, and sustainability questions have demanded change on energy usage and mobility.  From these megatrends, new technologies are being introduced, setting a new course that will require future technological breakthroughs.\n\nPrevious\nNext\n123456\n\nHYDROGEN ECO-SYSTEM SOLUTIONS\n\nThermal Management and Fluid Conveyance expertise to assist with industrial scale Hydrogen electrolysis, storage, distribution and hydrogen powered vehicle systems.\n\nComplete sub-assemblies consisting of – Heat Exchangers, Expansion Joints / Bellows, Corrugated Hose and Tubing\nMaterials expertise – Dedicated Engineering research with a wide range of materials including specialty stainless steels \nProjects – Energy Plants, Hydrogen Production, Refueling Stations, Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Powered Vehicles\nLocations – Global Manufacturing Footprint with R&D facilities in North America and Europe\n\nLearn More\n\nYour Organization’s Next Project Necessity.\n\nDoes your organization require thermal management expertise for a new product innovation?  Senior Flexonics has developed bellows systems which can withstand the extreme low temperature of liquid helium at -452 F as well as extreme heat environments of over 2000 F.  Materials experience includes brass, bronze, beryllium copper, 300 series stainless steel, titanium, Monel®, Inconel®, Hastelloy®, and other nickel alloys.

(PT&P) was founded as a pipe stress engineering firm in 1975. Our founder got his start by designing a thick-walled expansion joint for Dow Plaquemine. Dow was so pleased, they placed a large scale order to roll out the solution across all Dow plants, which allowed our founder to quit his job, and start PT&P. Over the last 45+ years, we've expanded and are now best known for manufactured products. However, our roots in engineering are core to our DNA and how we approach all aspects of the business. Today, PT&P is the only major global manufacturer of Engineered Pipe Supports and Expansion Joints. We have approximately 480 employees including 400+ production employees, 50+ design engineers, and 10 Industrial Engineers at our Houston Headquarters and other facilities. We have performed Field Service work in 41 countries, conducted over 1,000 plant audits, and worked with almost every major EPC, Petrochem, Chemical, and Power company. When you work with PT&P, you can be assured that no other company has seen and solved more issues around Piping Systems than we have.\n\nREQUEST A QUOTE\n \n\n\"Always happy with the service that we get from Piping Tech.

This sole source contract is the fifth consecutive 40mm systems contract awarded to AMTEC, representing 22 consecutive Government fiscal years (FY05 – FY26). The initial award value is $69.8 million, with deliveries scheduled to commence in late 2023. The maximum ceiling value of the contract is $826.8 million.

Our engineered trim solution is customised to fit your specific application and process, seamlessly integrating into the existing valve body without requiring changes to the body or top works.\n\n\n\n\nOur design principles are based on DRAG® technology, which directs fluid through a multi-stage, multi-path trim to reduce differential pressure incrementally, limit velocity head, and eliminate issues such as erosion, vibration, and noise.\n\nReduced installation time and costs\n\nBy implementing Retrofit3D, the cost of valve installation can be significantly reduced as many of the components involved in installation, such as engineering, pipe cutting, welding, pressure testing, and QA are eliminated. This means that you can save time and money by avoiding the need to replace the entire valve and undergoing a lengthy installation process. Instead, the engineered trim solution can be customised to each specific application and process and easily fitted into the existing valve body without the need for additional installation costs.\n\nLower downtime and cost of ownership\n\nExperience swift installation without any need for pipe cutting or rewelding. Our streamlined process ensures that you’ll be up and running within a matter of hours. But that’s not all. By opting for our innovative solution, you’ll also enjoy reduced maintenance requirements and enhanced efficiency, thanks to the remarkable trim performance it delivers.\n\nBlogs, news and case studies\n\n3D Printing service to disrupt valve market\n\nDISCOVER\n\nUndersized valve trim upgrade using Retrofit3D\n\nDISCOVER\n\nRetrofit3D: Up to 20″ valve components\n\nDISCOVER\n\nTaking 3D printed valve parts to the next level\n\nDISCOVER\n\nSaving valves for global energy giant\n\nDISCOVER\n\nKorean facility intensifies focus on 3D printing\n\nDISCOVER\n\nWet steam erosion solution at Korean CCPP\n\nDISCOVER\nPrevious\nNext\nDownloads\n\nBrochure\n302.6 KB (pdf)\n\nCase study: Prevent power loss\n810.8 KB (pdf)\n\nCase study: Low maintenance, high performance\n1.7 MB (pdf)\n\nCase study: Improve plant performance and valve reliability\n1.6 MB (pdf)\n\nCase study: New life for undersized valve\n409.8 KB (pdf)\n\nCase study: Solving severe vibration issues\n1.8 MB (pdf)\n\nCase study: Saving valves\n1.6 MB (pdf)\n\nSave time, reduce costs, and enhance efficiency\n\nFind out how we can improve your plant performance.\n\nLet’s talk\n\nIMI Process Automation is IMI's core sector for the design, manufacture and installation of highly engineered critical flow control systems for severe service and other challenging environments.\n\nVISIT THE IMI PLC WEBSITE\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR MAILING LIST\nContact Us\nProducts\nServices\nIndustries\nCompany\nTerms & Conditions (Legal)\nPrivacy Policy\nCookies Policy\nSite Map\nModern Slavery Act Statement\nCareers\n\nLanguage :English (UK)\n\n© 2025 , All Rights Reserved"

We represent a community of investors, including many entrepreneurs, and focus on lower-middle-market companies with up to $15 million in EBITDA — a level where our decades of experience indicate transformational growth can occur. As a family office with a flexible investment mandate, we think creatively and allow each opportunity to guide our investment structure and duration, absent the constraints imposed by a typical private equity fund. Our team has experience investing across many industries and sectors, including consumer products, industrial growth, education and business services. We partner with management teams to formulate flexible strategies, pursue strategic acquisitions and maintain appropriate capital structures.\n\nPARTNERSHIP\n\nWe rely heavily on the partnerships we form with management teams and business owners. We are not operators. We are value-added partners to managers seeking  to accelerate growth and increase value. We work closely with such teams to formulate strategies, pursue strategic acquisitions and maintain appropriate capital structures.\n\nFLEXIBILITY\n\nAs a family office, we have a more flexible model than a traditional private equity fund. We let each opportunity guide the investment structure and duration, and we’re eager to participate in both minority and majority ownership. Such flexibility also shows in our efforts to build companies. No two companies are the same; each growth plan must fit each situation.\n\nEXPERIENCE\n\nThe Promus Equity team has seasoned private equity professionals with decades of experience in the lower-middle market. Our team has experience in numerous economic cycles and a variety of industries. It’s rare that a partner company sees an opportunity or challenge that we haven’t already faced multiple times. Since Promus Equity’s founding in 2010, we have deployed capital into more than 20 companies — an investment pace built on the foundation of our partners’ careers in private equity.\n\nCOMMUNITY\n\nOur community of investors and extensive network of industry contacts is an important resource to management teams looking for fresh perspective or best practices. Our network’s collective experience is highly valuable to managers looking to overcome challenges or execute opportunities.\n\nINVESTMENT CRITERIA\n\nIn partnership with top-caliber management teams, Promus Equity invests in profitable lower-middle-market businesses with sustainable market positions, where our extensive experience and unique network can help accelerate growth. Our flexible investment mandate enables us to invest across many different industries and transaction types. We focus on companies below $150 million in revenue and investment opportunities where $5 million to $50 million of equity capital can be deployed.\n\nCOMPANY ATTRIBUTES\n\nEvery company has strengths and weaknesses. Promus seeks these attributes:\n\nPremium margins\nMultiple avenues for growth\nSustainable market position\nExcellent management\nCustomer and supplier diversity\nIndustry momentum\nINDUSTRY PREFERENCE\n\nWe invest across many industries but have particular strength in the following:\n\nBusiness services\nConsumer products\nDistribution\nEducation\nFood & beverage\nHealthcare\nProprietary industrial products\nTRANSACTION TYPES\n\nOur flexible capital allows each opportunity to guide our structure.

They wanted to replace the screws with permanent, tamper resistant fasteners that also supported lean manufacturing.\n\nSPIROL SOLUTION:\nSPIROL Engineering recommended replacing the screws with Press-N-Lok™ Pins that were specifically designed as retention pins for plastic enclosures.\nPress-N-Lok™ Pins have barbs that provide high retention in plastics. As the pins are pressed into the plastic, the barbs displace the plastic host material. After installation, the plastic backfills behind the barbs to lock the pins in place.\nThe assembly time for the Press-N-Lok™ Pins was much quicker and the assembly equipment costs was lower compared to the screws previously used.\nSPIROL's Press-N-Lok™ Pins simplified the assembly process, and eliminated scrap events associated with the installation of the screws.\nMechanical Clutch in Heavy Duty Right Angle Drill\nCUSTOMER CHALLENGE:\n\nThe lead engineer at a prominent hand and power tool company contacted SPIROL for help determining the best Disc Spring design for a new lightweight, compact, and portable Heavy Duty Right Angle Drill.\n\nSPIROL SOLUTION:\nSPIROL Engineering designed two special  stacked in series to meet the specific force and deflection requirements.\nDisc Springs offer a higher load capacity in less space as compared to conventional coil springs which enables the designer to make the tool more compact.\nUnlike Belleville Washers that are mostly used in static applications, Disc Springs provide unparalleled predictability, reliability and fatigue life in highly dynamic applications.\nBy partnering with SPIROL and incorporating our recommendation, the customer minimized costly development time and confidently launched their new high-quality drill to the market.\nAlignment Dowels in Lower Engine Block\nCUSTOMER CHALLENGE:\n\nA leading automotive manufacturer approached SPIROL for a cost-effective solution to precision align the lower engine block to the primary engine block.\n\nSPIROL SOLUTION:\nSPIROL's GD100 Ground Hollow Dowels are used where centerline tolerance and precision alignment are required as they maintain critical alignment within 20 µm.\nGD100 Ground Hollow Dowel reduce weight by over 50% as compared to the same size Solid Dowel.\nSPIROL's recommendation resulted in over $100,000 in annual cost savings as compared to other alignment options considered.\nConveyor Spacers\nCUSTOMER CHALLENGE:\n\nThe lead engineer at an industrial conveyor manufacturing company approached SPIROL to help resolve an issue caused by low quality plastic tubing used to separate skate wheel rollers from each other and from the conveyor walls.\n\nSPIROL SOLUTION:\nSPIROL's Application Engineers recommended replacing low cost, low quality plastic tubing with SPIROL's CS100 Conveyor Spacers\nCS100 Conveyor Spacers are stronger than plastic tubing and competitively priced.\nSPIROL's proprietary roll forming process enables custom lengths produced with no tool charges and fast turnaround times.\nBy partnering with SPIROL, the conveyor manufacturer was able to improve the quality of the assembly while concurrently controlling costs and inventory.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nHAVE A QUESTION?\nWe're Here to Help!\n\nHave a manufacturing issue you can't solve?

I got the light color in this and wow, completes my kitchen makeover! I'm shorter and I was worried it would be too deep, but it's perfect. I put an inexpensive dish drain in the bowl, it keeps things from banging around and it just works for me! Highly recommend.\nProduct : Swan 22\" x 33\" Granite Undermount Ascend Bowl\nDate : June 20, 2020\n★★★★★This was the perfect solution for a condo I was renovating to sell. I bought two for two different bathrooms with white vanities. The sink looks good, is light and easy to install. My goal was to make everything look new and clean. I was not expecting a marble or other high-end look. I read reviews that were disappointed and thought it looked cheap. I disagree. This met my expectations and was the perfect solution for the price.\nProduct : Swan Ellipse 43 in. W x 22 in. D Solid Surface Vanity Top with Sink in White\nDate : October 15, 2019\n★★★★★ This is probably the best shower pan on the market. I used another very popular brand last year in another bathroom and the first thing we had to do was put anti slip strips on it. Not easy as the bottom was textured and supposed to be non slip to begin with. NOT! If it is a shinny acrylic pan it is slippery and dangerous. I tore out a 25 yr old Swan TUB and full enclosure that did not have a flaw in it. Don't know how long they have been making things but all the products are top quality. This pan is not slippery at all and it is rock solid walking on. It feels like your walking on a tiled floor. I was very hesitant about the drain setup. I kept looking at it and saying to myself that has to leak. It not only does not leak but its the simplest drain I have ever installed.\nProduct : R-3248 32\" x 48\" Veritek Single Threshold Shower Pan\n★★★★★ I totally love this sink and highly recommend it. The house we bought has loud granite tops and it had a stainless steel sink very scratch up and not taken care of, \"ugly, ugly sink\" I bought this sink and my husband installed it for me and I love it, it toned down my very loud granite.\nProduct : Swan Drop-In/Undermount Granite 33 in. 1-Hole 60/40 Double Bowl Kitchen Sink in Granito\nDate : October 14, 2019\n★★★★★I've had this sink before and loved it so much that I knew I had to have it again in our new apartment. It is really great. Does not scratch and can be cleaned with cleanser or bleach.I LOVE IT\nProduct : Swan Drop-In/Undermount Solid Surface 25 in. 1-Hole Single Bowl Kitchen Sink in White\nDate : August 11, 2019\n    \nTools & Services\nSwanstone®\n\nTransform your bath or kitchen.\n\nSWANSTONE®\nPurchase Samples\n\nPurchase Swanstone®, Veritek or Granite sample chips.\n\nPURCHASE SAMPLES\nFor our Wholesale Partners\n\nFind out how Swan provides commercial solutions that last.\n\nPROFESSIONALS\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER:\n\nSUBSCRIBE\nFOLLOW US\nCOLLECTIONS AND FINISHES\nSwanstone®\nVeritek™\nGranite Sinks\nColors & Finishes\nCOMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS\nSwan Commercial Solutions\nHospitality\nStudent Housing\nABOUT\nAbout Swan\nCareers\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nYour Privacy Choices\nSERVICES\nContact Us\nFAQ\nProduct Maintenance\nWarranty\nABG Home Services\nSwan is a proud member of the American Bath Group family.AKER by MAAXAquaticBootzDreamlineMAAXMrSteamAll ABG Brands\nCookie Preferences\n\nThis website uses cookies to enhance your experience.

At Keller Fire Protection, we specialize in developing and implementing fire safety strategies tailored to the unique needs of each facility. Here’s why a well-structured fire protection plan is essential:\n\n1. Risk Assessment and Hazard Identification\n\nEvery industrial facility has its own set of risks based on the type of work, materials used, and layout. A detailed fire risk assessment identifies potential hazards—whether it’s highly flammable chemicals, machinery that generates heat, or crowded spaces with limited egress. This allows us to design a fire protection system specifically suited to your operation.\n\n2. Comprehensive Fire Safety Coverage\n\nA robust fire protection plan covers multiple aspects of fire safety:\n\nFire Detection & Alarm Systems: Early detection is key to preventing catastrophic loss. We provide and install state-of-the-art fire alarm systems that meet national and local standards.\nFire Suppression Systems: From sprinklers to clean agent suppression, we recommend and install suppression systems that are effective in controlling fires, tailored to your facility’s unique needs.\nFire Extinguishers: Strategic placement and proper maintenance of fire extinguishers throughout the facility is essential for fast action in the event of a fire.\nEmergency Evacuation Planning: Ensuring safe and timely evacuation of employees is critical. We help design clear evacuation routes and emergency procedures to minimize risk in an emergency.\n3. Compliance with Local, State, and National Codes\n\nIndustrial facilities must adhere to various regulations, including:\n\nNational Fire Protection Association (NFPA) codes such as NFPA 1: Fire Code, NFPA 70: National Electric Code, NFPA 5000: Building Construction and Safety Code, and others that dictate fire safety design and operation.\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements for workplace safety.\nInternational Fire Code (IFC) and International Building Code (IBC) that govern fire prevention and life safety. We ensure your facility complies with all relevant codes and regulations, avoiding penalties and ensuring the safety of your workforce.\n4. Routine Inspections and Maintenance\n\nCompliance isn’t a one-time effort; ongoing maintenance and inspections are required to keep systems in top condition. Keller Fire Protection offers regular inspections and testing of fire alarms, sprinklers, extinguishers, and suppression systems, ensuring they perform properly in case of an emergency.\n\n5. Employee Training\n\nA fire protection plan isn’t complete without training your staff to respond appropriately. We provide employee training programs on fire safety, emergency protocols, and the use of fire protection equipment, empowering your workforce to act quickly and effectively during an emergency.\n\n6. Emergency Response and 24/7 Service\n\nIn the event of a fire emergency, Keller Fire Protection is here to help.

      "textData": "Skip to content\nAbout\nProcess\nServices\nContact\nLet's Talk.\nBetter Hospitality Through\nCustom Manufactured  Solutions\n\nWeaver Manufacturing Company provides design services, custom manufacturing, and operations consulting  for the cruise and hospitality industries. Whether you need furniture and amenities designed and installed, a discontinued piece of equipment replicated, or a particularly difficult operational  problem solved, leverage the expertise of our experienced team  to deliver an uncompromising solution. Each custom made product is designed in collaboration with your team to meet the challenges of your unique operation because no two operations are the same.  We have the engineering background to understand the harsh, corrosive environment at sea plus the know-how and experience to build highly durable FF&E that will meet the demands of your 24/7 operation.  We look forward to learning about your operational problems and working alongside your team to solve them.\n\nDiscuss My Operational Challenge\nYour Guests Remember Everything That Goes Wrong\n\nIn hospitality, every detail counts. No matter how good the overall experience is—guests will remember and rate you based on the problems that they experience, down to the worn furniture, broken fixtures, and inefficient services.\n \nTo provide an  amazing guest experience it’s not enough to  make sure everything simply works right. You have to make sure the furnishings and equipment you bring into your space match your brand’s aesthetic and fit in with the total guest experience you want to provide.\n\nThat level of excellence is impossible if you’re using equipment and solutions designed for someone else.\n\n\n\nTo Offer a Unique Hospitality\nExperience, You Need Custom\nSolutions and Custom\nManufacturing\n\nSince your  guest experience is only as good as your weakest link, you need to work with a partner who has the expertise and commitment to optimize every aspect of your service.\n \nWhether you’re looking to design equipment that can withstand the tough conditions at sea, optimize material handling in different parts of your business, or create furniture that fulfills your hospitality vision, we have the expertise to deliver what you need.\n \nSo when you can’t afford to  compromise, partner with someone who takes the details as seriously as you do. Tell us the problem you need to solve and, together, we’ll find the solution that delivers the hospitality service your guests and crew deserve.\n\nDiscuss My Operational Challenge\nTruly Custom\nManufacturing Is the Key\nto Unrivaled Hospitality\n\nMany  manufacturers work with hospitality providers—but they always do it on their own terms. Some won’t let you customize the products you need. Others won’t produce small-batch orders.\n \nBut not Weaver Manufacturing Company. Weaver works on your terms because custom manufacturing should mean just that: custom. If custom manufacturing is done on the supplier’s terms, it won’t put your needs—or your guest’s experience—front and center.  When your aim is to deliver a unique hospitality experience, you need the custom solutions and equipment only our uncompromising experts can deliver.\n \nWeaver will do whatever it takes to make the product you want the way you want it. If you want a single-piece order today and thousands tomorrow, that’s no problem. If you have a problem you don’t know how to address, our experts will spend time on site until your problem is solved. If you want to iterate designs, Weaver’s design experts will help you optimize.\n\nOur\nCustomer\nA Custom Manufacturing\nProcess Built Around\nYour Needs\n\nTo  achieve custom hospitality solutions, work with a custom manufacturing expert who not only has the skills to deliver what you need—work with someone who will listen and collaborate with you every step of the way. We use a simple process that is designed to ensure your needs and goals are always front and center throughout the evolution of the solution. \n\nConsultation\n\nTell us about your unique problems and goals.\n\nDesign & Prototype\n\nWork with our experts in iterative design until we achieve the results you’re looking for.\n\nSample\n\nAsk us to build a sample prior to production if you would like to approve the design .\n\nProduction\n\nPlace your order for the quantity that you need.  We’ll communicate every step of the way about the order progress and schedule.\n\nDelivery\n\nWork with our production team to arrange pickup of your product at our factory or use our logistics team to arrange delivery to your final destination.\n\nOngoing Partnership\n\nCollaborate with us again as new problems or improvement opportunities arise within your operation.\n\nYour Vision of Hospitality\nWithout the Compromises\n\nCustom manufactured solutions will empower you to implement furniture, fixtures and equipment that work better, last longer, and improve your operational efficiency. . When you no longer have to worry about broken furniture, inefficient trollies and the burden of sourcing hard-to-find items, you have time to focus on what matters most – your guests and crew.  Like you, we want your guest’s experience to be unforgettably good and we want your crew to feel enabled and well equipped to perform their job.  We look forward to partnering with you to help you  realize your full hospitality vision and build a world class hospitality brand.  \n\nTestimonials\n“Weaver Manufacturing and team are outstanding to work with!   They have provided many options for items we use in operations, as part of our refits and new builds as well as custom solutions.   I highly recommend considering them for future purchases and projects.”\nVice President\n\nOperational & Strategic Services\n\n“Working with Weaver Manufacturing for many years I have always been most impressed and appreciative of the personal service, responsiveness and creativity of the Weaver team to come up with the most innovative responses to my business needs.  From concept discussions, to design briefs, and ultimate out of production, a seamless experience.”\n\nDirector\n\nHotel Supplies\n\n3101 Justin Road\nFlower Mound, Texas 75028 USA\n\ninfo@weavermanufacturing.com\n\n+1-214-232-2779\n\nMENU\n\nAbout\nProcess\nServices\nContact\nRequest a Solution Drawing\n© All Rights Received | Weaver Manufacturing 2023\nDesigned by Factur"

I had two offers before I finished the program, one of them being from Crane. I heard great things about them as an employer so I did my first outage for them that spring.

We have created a culture of innovation, where people are encouraged to take risks, to find creative ways to solve problems and compensate them for their trials.

In 2019 we started showing prototypes of our solution. We’d install it in one of their units, let them try it - and watch them be amazed. Several engineers were highly skeptical that we could achieve what we set out to do - saying it was mathematically impossible to create a materials system that goes from room temperature to 2100 degrees in under 2 seconds. But, we did it!!\n\nThis material system invention enables us to serve the global 230v markets as well someday hydrogen fueled gas appliances of the future.\n\nAnd it doesn’t stop there . . .\n\nSEE WHAT SCP IS WORKING ON NEXT\nSCP LIMITED\n1700 SOUTH INDIANA AVENUE\nAUBURN, INDIANA 46706\n(260) 925-2588\nHOMECAREERSABOUTLEADERSHIPPIPELINEQUALITY SOLUTIONSPRODUCTSAPPLICATIONSEMPLOYEE PORTALCONTACTTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n© 2024 Specialized Component Parts Limited"

This Q&A from Schatz Bearing, a leading provider of precision ball bearings, can get you started. What is the application? The best ball bearings are used in\n\nRead More »\nAerospace Ball Bearing Clients\n\nSchatz is an aircraft ball bearing manufacturer with products that are approved to standards from the likes of Boeing and the U.S. military. Unlike a supplier of bearings for ceiling fans or consumer appliances, Schatz specializes in the design of manufacturing of precision ball bearings for civilian and military aviation. Our quality management system is AS9100D certified, but that’s just part of what makes us a trusted aircraft bearing manufacturer. Keep reading to learn more, or view our on-line catalog of Made in USA aircraft bearings.\n\nAS9100D Bearings\n\nAS9100D is a quality standard for the aircraft, space and defense industry that has been endorsed by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Department of Defense (DoD). Revision D (AS9100D) is the current version of AS9100, which also references standards such as AS9102 for first article inspection (FAI). During FAIs, a manufacturer selects parts from a production run for testing, inspection, and documentation.\n\nAfter the results are documented, both the physical and functional characteristics of the part are verified against drawings, purchase orders, specifications, and other design documents. The first article inspection report (FAIR) includes the actual physical characteristics that were measured along with any non-conformities. Schatz is also ISO 9001:2015 certified, but our AS9100D certification means that we’re a manufacturer of aircraft bearings with the FAI and FAIR capabilities that you need.\n\nAerospace Ball Bearings Standards\n\nSchatz makes specific types, or series, of precision bearings that are approved to Boeing standards and U.S. military specifications. Visitors to our website can easily cross-reference Boeing part numbers to Schatz series numbers. Our website also lets visitors cross-reference Schatz series numbers to military part numbers. The term “U.S. military specifications” is sometimes abbreviated as MIL-SPEC or Mil Spec, but military and defense bearings generally begin with MS.\n\nSome military-approved bearings have AS designations instead. These standards are accepted by the DoD but developed by SAE International, a global association of engineers and technical experts in the aerospace, automotive, and commercial vehicle industries. As an experienced airframe bearing manufacturer, Schatz understands what’s required by these standards and can consistently manufacture quality products such as airframe control bearings for flight control or drive systems.\n\nAircraft Ball Bearing Materials\n\nBoeing, U.S. military, and SAE bearings standards define requirements such as materials of construction and part tolerances. For the rings and balls, aircraft bearings typically use these metals: SAE 52100, 440C or 440C modified, CREN high nitrogen stainless steel, or M50. Hybrid bearings with ceramic rolling elements and steel rings are also used and can support higher speeds and extended wear life. As a knowledgeable aircraft bearing manufacturer, Schatz can help you to compare these materials and evaluate them in terms of fatigue and corrosion resistance.   \n\nTolerances for bearings are allowable variations between manufactured parts. During the bearing design process, engineers can specify less expensive commercial tolerances or more expensive precision tolerances. In the aircraft and aviation industries, “tighter” or more precise tolerances are needed to meet demanding application requirements. Unlike a ceiling fan or a washing machine, the ball bearings on a commercial airliner or jet fighter must not fail as they withstand high speeds, temperatures and loads.\n\nSchatz is a Made in USA Aircraft Bearing Manufacturer\n\nIf you need aircraft bearings, it’s important to choose an AS9100D-certified manufacturer with approved products that meet tough industry standards. In addition to the right materials and tolerances, engineers and procurement personnel need to consider factors such as minimum order quantities and lead times. As a Made in America manufacturer, Schatz can help you to shorten your supply chain with reliable product deliveries from our distributor network or directly from our Poughkeepsie, New York facility.\n\n View our on-line catalog to learn more or contact Schatz  and let us know what you need.\n\nInformation\nMedia / News\nLegal Notice\nCareers\nDistributors\nContact\n\nPhone: (845) 452-6000 \nFax:      (845) 452-1660\nAddress: 10 Fairview Avenue,\nPoughkeepsie, NY 12601\nEmail: contact us\n\nPlease follow & like us :)\nFacebook\n \nLinkedin\nSign up for eNews\nPrivacy Policy\nLegal Notice\nSitemap\nAccessibility Statement\nAbout Us\nCareers\n© Schatz Bearing Corp.\nAll Rights Reserved"

Our tradition of safely accomplishing complex projects continues today. We will understand your project from day one to its completion, continually communicating and exercising proactive problem solving and value engineering.\n\nOne of the most effective ‘tools’ we use is the application of BIM or Virtual Design Construction. Whether your project is a new build or renovation of existing our experienced project teams will generate design verifications (for new build) or project visual coordination (for renovation).\n\nThis is accomplished by scanning the existing conditions and/or design verification of previously generated documents, resulting in a project ‘registration’ enabling a project's virtual environment.\n\nOur team secures robotic measurement points for the jobsite layouts; what follows is the scanned robotic verification of the proposed mechanical installation.\n\nIn essence, we are building your project in our office's CAD department before it's built at the jobsite.\n\nWith this level of accuracy, we can pre-fabricate a significant percentage of the mechanical systems in our ASME/NBI Code compliant 40,000 square foot fabrication facility. This integration dramatically improve accuracy, collision avoidance, construction schedules, safety, and job cost.\n\nThe data generated is also used for estimating, job cost tracking, forecasting, and importantly leaves the Owner with an excellent set of documents for their ongoing maintenance.\n\nExamine our Project Portfolio. Please contact us so we can assist you with your project.\n\n\n\nHome  |  History  |  Projects  |  Status  |  Certification  |  Q-Cards  |  Employment  |  Contact Us\n\nCopyright © 2025 Quackenbush Co., Inc.

Contact one of our dealers, it’s easy… click below and see.\n\nORDER NOW\n\nI picked up my official Hammer Clan badge today at the post office and it is gorgeous! Thanks for making it.  I’ll be proud to wear it and even prouder to live up to it!\n\nMarg FairGoldie Stone Belle Hammer\n\nI remain absolutely blown away at the badge. I wanted something to commemorate my 50 years as a firefighter-that started as an infant adopted from the unwed mother’s ward at the old Cook County Hospital in Chicago…along with the year I became a FF (1973) and my 50th year-and this could not have been or come out more perfectly. It is now truly my most prized memento.\nIf I can ever help you-never hesitate-\nThank you again\nBilly\n\nBilly GoldfederChief - Chicago Fire Department\n\nIn this modern world, its rare to encounter a product that stands out for its quality.  Blackinton badges do just that and I thought it appropriate to let you know.\n\nAn investigator’s badge was run over by a car not once but twice.  We recovered it.  The bottom of the badge was bent and the safety catch was completely flattened.  Remarkably the seal was unscathed.  I expected that forcing things back to where they were supposed to be would surely result in the safety catch breaking off and the panels breaking loose.  But, we had to try and the badge proved me wrong. Despite the significant force needed to achieve the goal, we were able to bend everything back and the badge is as pretty as the day we ordered it.   Kudos.\n\nP McCarthy MAIS InvestigationsSenior Vice President, Programs and Events - Gwinnett Chamber of Commerce\n\nI have been working with VH Blackinton for the past year and have been very impressed.  My contact, Sabine, is a great person in addition to being extremely professional and very knowledgeable. I highly recommend this company.\n\nLarry Earl\n\nOn behalf of the men and women of the Highland Park Police Department, thank you for all you did to ensure we would have the medals and recognition we need to appropriately honor the work they did. It means a great deal to me personally as well.\n\nLou Jogmen, Chief of PoliceSenior Vice President, Programs and Events - Gwinnett Chamber of Commerce\n\nA huge thank you to everyone who helped make sure I had this Purple Heart in hand for our Valor Awards yesterday. For those of you who do not know, this was presented to Officer Antwan Toney’s mom (who we flew in from California) who was shot and killed in the line of duty last October. His mom told me multiple times how pretty the purple heart was and how much she appreciated it.\n\nAlicia KroghSenior Vice President, Programs and Events - Gwinnett Chamber of Commerce\n\nToday I received my refinished badge and it is fantastic! You told me not to expect it to be as good as new, but I sure can’t tell any difference from the day I bought it some 40 years ago! It’s beautiful!\n\nI was so heartbroken when I saw the condition it was in with the water damage, my time as a deputy is still very dear to me and the thought of losing that tangible piece of my memories was terrible. Your team at the factory worked wonders! Please pass along my sincere thanks to them, as well.  Thank you so much!\n\nKeith HughesLieutenant - New Bern Police Department\n\nI know often times you only hear from us dealers when we have a problem. I wanted to share with you this GREAT email regarding the largest order we have ever made with Blackinton. Please pass on my sincere gratitude and thanks to everyone that was involved in this project. You had the product produced and out the door in a efficient and timely manner and everything went like clockwork! Thank you again for your assistance and lets keep up the great work.\n\nBrad Abney, Ryders Public SafetyLieutenant - New Bern Police Department\n\nOnce again, I cannot express enough how pleased we are with our badges. It seems like everyday someone is commenting on their beauty and craftsmanship, which usually leads to conversations about our city and the imageries depicted on the badge. These badges have given us a sense of unique identity when worn in the presence of others, a badge we are all proud to wear. What once started out as only a hand sketched vision of the design, you and your team were able to make it a reality. We are forever grateful to you and all of the amazing staff who worked so diligently on our project.\n\nJason WilliamsLieutenant - New Bern Police Department\n\n“The badges I requested arrived today… They are WOW, WOUNDERFUL, SPLENDERFOUS, EXQUISITE!!! THANK YOU!!!”\n\nMark ConnorsConstable - The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania\n\n​We have been in business since 1914 and have always used Blackinton for our badge needs. First and most importantly the sales staff.. timely and professional. Secondly is customer service, they have always been the friendliest of any vendor I have worked with. And finally the quality of the products has always been impeccable, I have never had to return an item sold to one of my customers…”\n\nWilliam PlumbOwner - Yearwoods, Inc.\n\nThe production sample of our Anniversary Custom Badge arrived today.  The badge looks GREAT and my entire staff is extremely happy with the finished product.  Thank you  for all your help in the design and production of the badge.\n\nChuck KelleyDirector of Public Safety - Stone Mountain Park Police\n\nI received the badge the other day. It looks fantastic! Everyone at the PD loves it. I’m looking forward to wearing it in October\n\nPaul MaliskaSergeant - Gulf Shores Police Department\n\nI received my badge last night. It looks great.  Thank you so much.  It means a lot to me since it was the 1st badge I received 36 years ago.  The workmanship is outstanding. Again thank you so much!\n\nMr. StommesSergeant - Gulf Shores Police Department\n\nNEVER MISS ANY NEWS\nSUBSCRIBE HERE!\n\n\t"

In 1968, man was yet to walk on the moon, computers were enormous, and the plastics industry was about to boom. For a family business in Syracuse, NY, 1968 would mark the beginning of legacy as a leading manufacturing supplier to some of the biggest companies in the world.\n     Founded by John and Betty Armstrong, who came to the U.S. from Coventry, UK, where John started out as a Wood and Metal Pattern Maker apprentice, Armstrong RM began with modest dreams of building a small firm of five. Today, as the company celebrates its 50th anniversary, Armstrong employs over 150 people, headed up by the family’s next generation.\n     “I was 9-years-old and with my dad at the plant when the first equipment was delivered,” Peter Armstrong, President of Armstrong RM recalls. “I didn’t have a clue what it was. Today, decades later, I still see some of that original equipment as I walk around our plant.”\n     When Armstrong started out, the company intended to make cast molds for plastic molding, but soon got into the RIM (Reaction Injection Molding) process when a customer problem turned into an opportunity. A clothing designer came to Armstrong to produce a mannequin mold but soon struggled to find anyone to run the body forms. A short conversation with a local material supplier later and a 50-piece order for RIM polyurethane was made.\n\n\n\n\n(Click Icons to View Certificates)\n\n\n\n\n(Click Icons to View Certificates)\n\n\n\nArmstrong RM Corporation:\n\nOur company manufactures metal and plastic components in prototype and low-volume production quantities. Whether it is 1 or 5,000 parts, we deliver production-grade components and assemblies that meet your demanding delivery schedules.\n\nWith many complementary processes, we can assist you in producing everything from prototype die castings to large plastic enclosures.\n\nProcesses Offered\nRubber Plaster Molding (RPM)\nGraphite Die Casting\nPrecision Airset Sand Casting\nOne-Shot Casting\nReaction Injection Molding (RIM)\nRapid Injection Molding via Cast Tooling\nCNC Machining and Hogouts\nServices Offered\nCAD Design\nDFM Expertise\nRapid Prototyping\nAssembly\nPainting and Finishing\n\nIn addition to the processes and services listed above, we also offer unique solutions (originally designed to meet our customers' unmet needs) such as form-in-place gasketing.\n\nIndustries Served\n\nFrom our multi-plant operations in Syracuse, New York, we support the design and manufacturing demands of companies like yours throughout the United States. From aerospace to medical devices to military, we rapidly deliver high tolerance parts, sub-assemblies and complete assemblies. While not all industries have the demands of aerospace and military, we hold ourselves to these stringent requirements for every industry that we serve.\n\nTelecommunications\nAutomotive\nAerospace/Military\nMedical Diagnostic and Test Equipment\nBusiness Machines\nConsumer Products\nEmerging Technologies\nIndustrial Goods\nPower Tools\n\nWhile there are many other industries that we serve, they each have one thing in common; the need for exceptional quality and rapid delivery backed by extensive experience and know-how in manufacturing processes.\n\nCraftsmanship + Technology\n\nOur founder, John Armstrong, established Armstrong RM in 1968 with old-world craftsmanship and ideals. We have built upon this foundation of manufacturing expertise and dedication to quality by adding advanced technologies such as CNC machining, CAD solid modeling and rapid prototyping. A testament to our quality practices and procedures is our certification to the ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management System Standard.\n\nAs a designer or engineer, you are pressed to design sophisticated products quickly and accurately. But today, your job doesn't stop there. You now find that you are also responsible for the production of these products. This is where we can really help.\n\nAssist in Selection and in Design for Process\n\nArmstrong RM uses its experience and knowledge in manufacturing processes to help you select the right method and the right material for the job. And since design for manufacturing isn't always the same as a finished parts design, we offer our talents in designing your parts for the process. So, you don't have to worry about designing a metal part for its \"as-cast\" state or plastic part for moldability. We take care of that for you, so that you can start tackling your next design challenge.\n\nSo, if your design is nearing completion and you now need to manufacture prototypes or production parts, turn to Armstrong RM. Call us today to discuss your project or send us a request for quotation. You will be glad you did.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nArmstrong RM Corporation | 6910 Manlius Center Road\nEast Syracuse, New York 13057-9597\nPhone: (315) 437-1517 | Fax: (315) 437-9198 | sales@armstrongrm.com\n\nSitemap | Home\n\n©2023 Armstrong RM Corp.

With capital costing more today than it has in the last decade and a half, this is the delivery package everyone needs to succeed in today’s highly competitive marketplace.\n\nWe offer a package of steel pipe, plastic pipe, copper tube, strut and threaded rod sourced from world class mills here in the USA and across the globe. Currently we utilize six strategically located distribution centers east of the Rockies to service local regions through a J-I-T (Just-In-Time) inventory replenishment platform.\n\nIn addition of keeping you priced competitively – you also save on shipping by buying the package of products offered by KSD. Once you meet the low FFA requirement – anything above this effectively rides for free – which is a great advantage when purchasing products that are big and bulky. Packaging multiple products together also creates an internal savings for our customers as well – one PO leads to one shipment and one invoice – streamlining the process.\n\nThe bottom line? At KSD, we strive to exceed your expectations each and every day. We take great pride in the quality, integrity and reputation of the products we bring to market, and our long-term supplier relationships are a testament to our enduring commitment to our customers.\n\nClick To View Our Locations\n\n \n\nPRODUCTS\n\nPipe | Tubing\n› Copper Tubing & Coils\n› Steel Pipe\n› Plastic\n› Strut\n› Threaded Rod\n› NorthEast Only\n\n© Copyright 2020 Kessler Sales & Distribution • All rights reserved\nDesigned & Maintained by Creative Marketing Alliance (CMA)"

We invite you to learn about our prototyping and production capabilities by browsing the pages of our web site.  In July of 2017, Lanzen acquired the assets of Demmer Corporation’s Petoskey Machining operations, an acquisition that greatly expands our machining capabilities. The Petoskey facility was relocated to Harbor Springs in July 2019. In addition to our vertical machining capability, Lanzen now has turning, horizontal milling and 5 axis machining capabilities. The resources of all three facilities can operate independently, or by integrating today’s technologies, those resources can be combined to act as a single manufacturing stream. Pioneering ideas like this, in conjunction with innovative engineering, program management and a modern mix of production equipment and systems, has led to Lanzen’s long term growth and success. Our defense industry customers, include the US Government, BAE Systems, General Dynamics, Lockheed, Raytheon, AM General, and many others.   We manufacture metal assemblies and welded fabrications from carbon and alloy steel, armor plate, aluminum, titanium and copper in all shapes and many sizes. \n\nISO 9001 CERTIFIED\n\nVENDOR SQARS\n\nSUPPLIER SQM\n\nTERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nLANZEN INCORPORATED\n\n100 Peyerk Ct\n\nRomeo, MI 48065\n\nPhone: 586-785-3340\n\nFax: 586-281-3177\n\nLANZEN-MANCELONA\n\n611 N.E.

Whether installing and designing systems in new construction or updating existing service, Sharlen has proven its versatility and capability time and again. Sharlen’s hands-on project management style ensures superior craftsmanship and reliability in any project they take on.”\n\n- TED STALNOS: PRESIDENT\nCalumet Area Industrial Commission\n\n“KJWW Engineering has worked with Sharlen Electric in a traditional contractor/consultant role. I have been impressed by Sharlen’s staff they provided at St. James Hospitals and Clinics for numerous projects, including the 2000 Master Plan project, which was a substantial addition to their existing Olympia Fields campus. In particular, Don Voss as the project manager has been the best I’ve ever had the privilege of working with. Our relationship was more of teaming and not the “traditional” adversarial role. Don was always ahead of the game, looking ahead and not waiting till issues were in a time-sensitive crisis. This gave us time to plan a correct course that served the owner’s best long-term needs. His leadership and advance planning made Sharlen Electric a stand out in my opinion. In-so-much, when asked by clients for recommendations for electrical contracting, Sharlen Electric is always at the top of my list.”\n\n- RICK GILSON: SENIOR ENGINEER\nKJWW Engineering\n\n“Working with Sharlen Electric over the past 20 years has been a great experience. While at Leopardo Construction, I had the pleasure of working with many of their talented professionals on numerous retail projects in the Chicago market. When your project is tasked with field conditions or engineering challenges, you can count on Sharlen Electric to roll up their sleeves, creatively work through the issues, and deliver cost-effective solutions on a timely basis. I look forward to Sharlen’s expertise to support our future project opportunities at Clark Street development.”\n\n- DAVID LOW JR.: PARTNER & VICE PRESIDENT\nClark Street Development\n\n“It has been refreshing to work with a company that understands and is dedicated to the “team” approach and assists the general contractor in making the construction process efficient and economical. Sharlen takes special care to ensure that the finished building meets or exceeds all of their respective expectations, and they are especially good to work with in the design phase.”\n\n- AL RAFFIN\nRaffin Construction Company\n\n“We are proud of the many projects that Walsh Construction and Sharlen Electric have built together. Best to the Cullen family and all at Sharlen.”\n\n- SEAN WALSH: MANAGING DIRECTOR\nWalsh Construction Group\n\n“Sharlen has time and again exceeded our expectations with regard to quality of work, timeliness, and the ability to bring solutions to problems encountered in the field during the course of construction.\n\nOur firm is known as one of the quickest Interior specialty contractors in the Chicago market. We have NEVER failed to deliver a quality project on time with reasonable cost. We demand competent and well equipped crews, sufficient staffing, and forward thinking tradespeople from our subcontractors. Sharlen has NEVER failed us no matter how big or small our project may be.\n\nThe rlectrical trade is probably the most “pivotal” trade in our field of work. They can make or break a project schedule which impacts all trades. We expect the electrical contractor to be our “catalyst” with regard to project pace and work flow. Sharlen has always met that task, which allows IAI to exceed the customer’s expectations.”\n\n- BOB MCKENNA: CO-PRESIDENT\nIAI Interior Alterations, Inc.\n\n“We have worked with Sharlen Electric on many projects over the years. These projects have been performed on a traditional bid basis, design-assist, and design-build process in a wide variety of markets such as educational, residential, institutional, and interior buildout. They have demonstrated their expertise in preconstruction, BIM technology, and quality. The projects have all been done very successfully for both the owner and O’Neil. They have proven to be good business partners, dependable, responsive, and fair. We would highly recommend Sharlen for any type of projects and view them as a preferred contractor.”\n\n- MICHAEL J. FARON: CHAIRMAN\nW.E. O'Neil Construction\n\n“Sharlen Electric has been a subcontractor to many of our award-winning designs. They are not just responsive, but they do share a concern to improve quality while maintaining a tight grip on costs. We couldn’t ask for more.”\n\n- DAN MCCAFFERY: CEO\nMcCaffery Interests, Inc.\nPrevious\nNext\nOUR AFFILIATIONS\nSharlen Electric is proud to be affiliated with the organizations below.\n \n \nWE'RE STANDING BY TO SERVE YOUR NEEDS\nNeed electrical services?

In filtration systems, solids are removed from the liquid by flowing through a permeable medium that stops the solids, allowing only clean liquid to pass through. This process can be vital for many industries that depend on contaminant-free liquids.\n \nRosedale Products is a leading technology developer in the field of liquid filtration systems and waste minimization products for customers throughout the world. At Rosedale, we produce an exceptional product line that includes high performance filtration solutions for multiple industries, including automotive, food and beverage, pharmaceutical, oil and gas, and more.\nRosedale Products Provides a Range of High Performance Liquid Filtration Solutions\nAt Rosedale Products, we provide innovative filtration devices and liquid filtration systems for specific industrial applications. Our industrial liquid filtration system products and solutions are extremely efficient and are designed and manufactured from premium materials that withstand the test of time.\nIndustrial filtration systems are designed to separate contaminants and particles from liquids. They allow liquid to pass through the membrane, removing the solids that are too large. Our industrial water filtration systems are ideal for applications requiring high-purity water. Ultra-pure water is essential for multiple industries including medical, semi-conductor manufacturing, solar paneling and more.\nHousings for Filtration Systems\nRosedale Products liquid filtration housings are available in numerous sizes and styles, and can serve as a bag filter housing, cartridge filter or basket strainer.  The industrial filter housings are opened without special tools, and the elements are easily cleaned or replaced. \nCartridges for Filtration Systems\nFilter cartridges capture solid contaminants, removing particles and debris from water and industrial liquids. Depth-type filter cartridges capture the contaminants throughout the filter structure, while surface-type filter cartridges capture the contaminants on the outermost layer.\nFilter Bags\nBag filters are designed to remove contaminant and debris from liquids. The amount and size of contaminants the filter bags remove depends on their specific micron rating.  Rosedale Products offers several unique options for your filter bag project requirements.\nFiltration System Baskets\nFilter baskets are durable, cost-effective filters that can protect valuable equipment from potential damage, while removing debris and contaminants from liquids. Different filter basket types are designed to remove various sizes of contaminants, depending on your exact specifications.\nReplacement Filter Parts\nWe offer replacement parts and bags to ensure that your filtration system continues to perform up to standard. We carry replacement parts for a variety of models to meet your needs.\nFiltration System Accessories\nFiltration systems are necessary for many industries to ensure that their equipment is operating at peak efficiency. Water filtration systems remove particles, debris, and contaminants from water or other liquids, promoting greater efficiency and lower maintenance costs. Our water and gas filtration accessory products are designed to maximize liquid filtration system performance capacity.\nCustom Manufacturing Solutions\nWe can build anything from simple modifications on standard housings, to customer specified skid-mounted filtration systems. We have a long history of innovative custom filtration designs, and we will work with you to find the right options and accessories that meet your specific needs.\nContact Rosedale Products, Inc. as Your Trusted Liquid Filtration Systems Manufacturer\n\nWe have distributors worldwide to provide you with the liquid filtration systems and waste minimization products that your application requires.

For 30 years our flowers have been artfully designed into one of a kind bookmarks, glass magnets, and utilized for custom invitations and craft projects. Petal Lane Floral continues to design and create natural gifts and souvenirs here in the USA.\n\nTen years ago, with the help of our three daughters, Mikey, Lindie, and Bailey, we started working on a magnet board idea that quickly grew into another busy operation, Petal Lane Home. Today, in addition to our flower operations, we design and arrange a lot of different home decor items. Everything from beautiful framed artwork, magnet boards, letter boards, canvas banners, glass magnetic boards, and much more!We are grateful for a business that employs family and friends here in our small community of Richfield, Utah. We love being able to say that our flowers and home decorations are made locally here in the USA.\n\nBest,\nChet and Lenita Thompson\n\nLogin\nWholesale\nPurchase a Gift Card\nOur Story\nContact\nFAQs\nShipping & Returns\nTerms of Use\nBecome an Ambassador\nFacebook\nInstagram\nPinterest\n© 2025, Petal Lane Home | Site by Common Collectif\nSelect\nRemove"
