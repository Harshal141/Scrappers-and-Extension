Glass Packaging.\n\nGlass is a material unlike any other, capable of creating stunning, memorable experiences, and it’s the most sustainable packaging material on earth. At O-I, we have a history of transforming how the world stores food and beverages – of making glass more accessible to more customers and consumers. We reimagine how glass is made and sold by innovating production techniques, pioneering recycling and sustainable technology, and unleashing the iconic, brand-building potential of this packaging that is the kindest material for the planet and its people.\n\nRead Our Story\nNews and Stories\nAdvancing Glass Recycling Through Groundbreaking Programs and Partnerships in 2024\nDECEMBER 18, 2024\nKentucky Glass Recycling Gets a Green Boost: Ale-8-One and O-I Lead the Charge\nDECEMBER 10, 2024\nIn Quest to Produce the Most Sustainable Bottled Water, Beika Turns to O-I for Packaging\nDECEMBER 3, 2024\nDesign Book 3: Creative Reality - Innovative Solutions to Packaging Concepts\nOCTOBER 3, 2024\nOUR VISION\nShaping the Future Through Glass\n\nWe create iconic, healthy glass packaging so synonymous with brands, you recognize those brands by their packaging alone, even without a label. We innovate packaging design to enable customers to meet their own ambitions, from connecting with consumers on an emotional level to creating a more sustainable future.\n\nOUR STORY\nDriven Through Innovation\n\nInnovation and transformation are in our DNA. O-I Glass was founded more than a century ago by a man whose glass bottle making machine was called the most significant invention in glass in 2000 years. Founder Michael J. Owens’ motto was “It can be done.” And we’re doing it. We’re reimaging what glass can do, making it the world’s most versatile, charismatic and sustainable packaging material.\n\nOUR MISSION\nOur Sustainability Vision\n\nGlass is the ideal packaging material to support a low-waste, circular economy. But sustainability isn’t just about what we make – it’s also about how we make it. Sustainability is woven into everything we do, from transforming our glass-making technology and processes to our customer approach to how we engage our employees and support our communities.\n\n1\n2\n3\nPower of\nGlass Packaging\n\nGlass is pure, sustainable, and the kindest packaging material for the health of people and the planet. Glass has an element of magic to it. It is beautiful and iconic. It can turn into shapes. It plays with the senses. Glass is 100% recyclable and infinitely recyclable. It does not increase ocean pollution. Glass is virtually inert, which means it doesn’t interact with the foods and beverages it holds.\n\nWe love glass and we aspire to create a healthier, more sustainable, and more exciting world through glass packaging.\n\nDiscover Benefits of Glass\nGuided by Our Values\n\nAt O-I, we deeply care about our people and our culture. Guided by our values and behaviors, we’re constantly seeking to transform how we support and engage employees and the communities in which we work and live.\n\nSee Our Careers\nStay Connected\n\nFollow along on social media as we transform glass packaging and discover what’s possible with glass.\n\nMake 2025 the year of fewer microplastics by...\n\n 4  0\nOpen\n\nAnyone focused on #cleanliving in 2025?

Fortunately, innovation is in our family company's DNA, and we combine that inventive nature with state-of-the-art facilities and unparalleled experience in bringing new products to market.\n\nOUR CAPABILITIES\n\nOur food capabilities explained in just six words: You need it, we got it! Yes, that’s a bit simplistic, a little boastful and not exactly eloquent, but it’s absolutely spot on. With five decades of experience, state-of-the-art facilities and seasoned professionals, LiDestri can provide a comprehensive range of food products and services that is one word: amazing.\n\nWe’re specialists in sauces, salsas, dips and can get up-to-speed for whatever you need. Across all of our lines we have specialists solely dedicated to producing and improving processing techniques and packaging for everything we produce.\n\nOUR INNOVATION CENTER\n\nFor most consumer product R&D companies – whether working on a dip, sauce or salsa – manufacturing happens on two scales: small-batch and full-scale production. That approach is limited, since what works in a test kitchen may not translate to a scalable mass-market product.\nThe LiDestri Innovation Center is the answer to that problem.\n\nCreated in 2014, the Innovation Center provides our national brand and private label partners with the facilities, equipment, and expertise necessary to develop products from scratch in an environment that accurately simulates full-scale production. Our product development connoisseurs, certified tasters, process improvement experts, and packaging designers help our partners improve their existing products to craft and produce some amazing original offerings.\n\nWHAT OUR CUSTOMERS SAY ABOUT INNOVATION AT LIDESTRI\n\nIn this testimonial from Newman’s Own President and CEO Mike McGrath, LiDestri’s decades-long consumer packaged goods (CPG) partner describes our contract manufacturing approach to innovation in the co-creation of Common Good Organic Pasta Sauce.\n\nIn this testimonial from Wegmans Food Markets CEO Danny Wegman, LiDestri’s decades-long retail brand partner describes our contract manufacturing approach to innovation in the co-creation of Organic Food You Feel Good About Jammin’ fruit spreads.\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT HOW WE INNOVATE\nNEWS AND PRESS\n\nRead all about it! As an industry leader with a reputation for breakthrough innovation, LiDestri is often positively featured in news coverage in both mainstream media and top trade publications. New product introductions, breakthrough processing technologies, packaging innovations, plus insights and opinions by LiDestri experts and executives often make news.\n\n\n\n\n\nOUR INDUSTRY CERTIFICATIONS\n\nAt LiDestri we understand that increased governmental and consumer interest in food safety, regulatory compliance and product traceability are more important than ever. It’s important that our partners, suppliers and everyone who consumes our products know that we meet or exceed all certification requirements for each line of business.\n\nInnovation\n \nFood\n \nPartner with LiDestri\nLearn\n \nPress\n \nCareers\n \nCorporate Responsibility\n \nContact\n \n \nLiDestri Foods | 815 W.

We pride ourselves on personalized service. \n\nGlass — The Natural Alternative\n\nGlass is made  from all-natural materials. It is the preferred packaging among customers who value it for maintaining the purity of the foods and beverages they consume.\n\nISO Standards of Excellence\n\nGallo Glass is committed to providing a safe and healthful workplace that manufactures quality products, according to food safety standards, in an environmentally responsible and energy efficient manner. We are ISO 14001 and 22000 certified. \n\nOver\n\nYears of Innovation\n0\n1950s\nWhen it All Began\n\nWhen Ernest and Julio Gallo founded the Gallo Glass Company in 1958, they were launching a new era in bottle making. They had a vision for state-of-the-art glass manufacturing that would meet the needs of consumers while minimizing the impact on the environment.\n\n1970s\nBreaking Through the Turbulence\n\nWhen many glassmaking factories were shutting their doors because of the energy crisis, Gallo glass was picking up steam. With the addition of two new furnaces, they we able to manufacture more bottles with five operating furnaces.\n\n1980s\nThinking Smarter, Not Harder\n\nWith the rising environmental concerns over glass manufacturing, Gallo made its process more efficient and less wasteful. They invested in triple gob coolers and designed smaller bottles. They also switched from mechanical to computerized timing control.\n\n1990s\nTaking Oxy-Fuel Firing Full Steam\n\nMany companies were researching effective methods for reducing NOx emissions, but Gallo Glass was a pioneer at making it possible on a larger scale by building their first cryogenic oxygen facility armed with electrostatic precipitator emissions control equipment.\n\n2000s\nA Clear Path for a New Era\n\nThe installation of modern equipment and processes gave a boost to the firing and manufacturing speed. With that Gallo was able to increase the overall quality, ISO and automation for bulk production while decreasing bottle weight.\n\n2010s\nSeeing a Sustainable Future\n\nThroughout the decades, glassmaking has revolutionized for the sake of the environment and Gallo Glass is proud of what they’ve contributed. They continue their commitment to sustainability by maintaining state-of-the-art furnaces, modern manufacturing processes and control practices.\n\nPrevious\n1970s\n1980s\n1990s\n2000s\n2010s\n1950s\n1970s\n1980s\n1990s\n2000s\n2010s\n1950s\n1970s\n1980s\n1990s\n2000s\n2010s\nNext\nWe are dedicated to upholding the highest environmental standards and leading the global glass industry with energy-efficient furnaces.\nGallo Glass was the first industrial application of oxy fuel technology in container glass, reducing NOx emissions by 80% or the equivalent to taking over 97,000 cars off the road.\nWe are on the forefront of innovation across the industry with advancements in lighter weight bottles, Eco Flint, clear glass flint reclamation, and so much more.\nTel: 209.341.4527 (GLAS)\n\n© 2024 Gallo Glass Company ALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nISO 14001\n\nISO 22000\n\nJOIN OUR TALENT NETWORK\nUse Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\nSuppliers\n\nAn Equal Opportunity Employer – All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or status as a protected veteran."

      "textData": "EN\nABOUT US PRODUCTS SERVICE MANUALS CAREERS SUPPLY CHAIN\nWELCOME TO MEKRA LANG NORTH AMERICA\n\nMEKRA Lang North America (MLNA), an independent company of the MEKRA Group, is the leading manufacturer of rear view vision systems for commercial vehicles. This North American facility also houses the primary engineering, research and design operations for the Western Hemisphere.\n\nBehind the doors of its growing 160,000 square foot facility in Ridgeway, South Carolina, the story of MLNA unfolds every day in the lives of its employees and the quality of their work. As a technology-based company, with its focus on innovation and the design of high-quality products, the MEKRA Group has achieved a position of global leadership within the industry.\n\nFrom its founding in 1994, MLNA has grown from a management team of five employees to a workforce of more than 200. Fully-equipped engineering, quality and testing departments support the development of new design and product innovations for customers worldwide. With the addition of an expanded administrative area in May 1999 and plant expansions in 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2006, MLNA looks to the future with the capability to address the growing needs of current and prospective customers.\n\nPerhaps the most striking impression a visitor to MLNA will get is the sense of ‘family’ amongst its employees, which is at the root of the company's history and growth. The original company, established in Fuerth, Germany in 1932, was the vision of its founders, Hans and Frieda Lang.\n\nWhen a company begins by valuing its employees, everyone benefits. MLNA produces the world's highest quality, most technologically advanced mirror systems for a growing list of customers. MLNA has achieved ISO 9001, ISO 14001, IATF 16949 and ISO/IEC 17025 certifications. In 1999 and 2002 MEKRA Lang was named 'South Carolina's Manufacturer of the Year' for its outstanding dedication to product quality.\n\nMEKRA LANG NORTH AMERICA, LLC\n101 Tillessen Boulevard\nRidgeway, SC 29 130\n+1 803 337 52 64\n+1 803 337 52 65\nsales@mekralang.us\nhttp://www.mekralang.us/\nABOUT US\n Facilities\n Community\n Competencies\nPRODUCTS\n Mirror Solutions\n Camera Monitor Systems\n Mirror Replacement\n Digital Network Camera\n Electronic Accessories\nSERVICE MANUALS\nCAREERS\nLEGAL NOTICE\nPRIVACY POLICY\nEQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY POLICY\n© MEKRA Lang GmbH & Co.

Originally built to produce minnow-roach bait traps, a change in ownership and the company name in the mid-1950s resulted in a shift to food-grade containers -- a product that we still produce today. Proud to be American owned, Arkansas Glass Container Corporation, makes glass containers ranging from 8 ounces to one-gallon. We also offer a family of patented designed containers called the Stout, used for sauces, beverages or dressings.\n\nOur History\nOur Products\n\nTake a look at our expansive catalog of glass containers in varying shapes and sizes.

It sets you apart – on the shelf, and in the mind of your customers.\n\nAnd for too long, the big-time container manufacturers have treated producers as an afterthought.\n\nNot anymore. Welcome to Arglass.\n\nOUR CORE VALUES\n\nThe glass container industry is dominated by manufacturers that cater to the behemoths. That means you have to put in bigger orders than you want. Tolerate long runs. And endure delay after delay.\n\nBut with Arglass, you get:\n\nJust about any shape.\nJust about any color.\nNo large-volume requirements.\nExactly what you want. Imagine that!\n\nWith our brand-new next-generation US-based plant, Arglass is out to change everything about the way bottlers, distillers and food manufacturers – from small and mid-sized producers to the largest companies in their industry – create best-in-class bottles and containers.\n\nOUR FOUNDING PRINCIPLES\nFLEXIBILITY\n\nWe pride ourselves on being lean, nimble and responsive to our customers’ needs, no matter how rapidly they might change. Shape, color, size, quantity: we’re in business to say yes.\n\nEFFICIENCY\n\nOur new plant is built to optimize everything about glass container production, from new product design to energy consumption. We produce the highest quality containers with the most efficient use of time and resources (both ours and yours).\n\nSUSTAINABILITY\n\nAs focused as we are on what we produce, we’re equally concerned with how we produce it.\n\nSustainability is one of our founding principles because manufacturing the highest quality glass containers means using the best technology to reduce our environmental impact, eliminate industrial waste water, minimize energy consumption, and use renewable and recycled materials throughout the manufacturing process.\n\nAt Arglass, we share our clients’ commitment to high quality products and smooth, efficient, sustainable processes.\n\nOUR PLANT HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO PRODUCE CONTAINERS IN ALMOST ANY SHAPE AND COLOR WITHOUT LARGE-VOLUME COMMITMENTS.

Your company has become very reliable. We are able to schedule the installers with the confidence that all the product will be there and that they can complete what they came to do. Thus, we have fewer return trips and charges. [Thermo-Tech’s Service Department] is always willing to take the time to talk to us about any concerns and scheduling of any needed repairs. We have gone from a company that has one to two window items on a final walk through to virtually none. My wife, who is not in the building business, would love to tell just how much she enjoys the ease of use and the hassle-free cleaning of the Thermo-Tech Windows in our new home. It is a true pleasure to work with your company. Thank you.”\n\nJonny Mills – Avalon Homes\n\n“Thermo-Tech windows have proven to be an integral part of customizing our home. The flexibility of their design staff allowed us to create windows that are truly our own. Quality of the product is outstanding. They look great, function perfectly, and are a breeze to clean. (Even for those of us who hate washing windows!)”\n\nHomeowner from St. Cloud, Minnesota\n\n“We are the owners of a forty-four year old home filled with charm and character. Unfortunately, along with its charm and character came drafty windows. We were looking for a window in our kitchen area that would not only keep to the style of our home but also provide us with easy maintenance, energy efficency, and affordability. We found that at Thermo-Tech Windows. Due to the vinyl on the windows there is no outside maintenance required and the inside maintenance is a simple dusting — no more yearly varnishing or painting! Besides no more drafty windows we have also noticed a marked decrease in the amount of outside noise. The gentle bow of the window gives the illusion of bringing the outdoors in as well as giving additional depth to the room. We love our window and are looking forward to adding yet even more Thermo-Tech windows in the near future.”\n\nJohn and Pat\n\n“We are very pleased with the quality of our new Thermo-Tech patio door and windows. The installation process was very smooth and fast. Sixteen windows and the patio door only took a couple of days to install. The wood grain around the windows matched our interior wood perfectly. The first thing we noticed about our new windows was how quiet our house was, and how bigger and brighter our whole house looks. Our heating and cooling bills have decreased significantly due to our Thermo-Tech windows. Maintenance and cleaning are a breeze. We feel good about buying windows and doors made right here in central Minnesota and we know the quality is excellent.”\n\nDenny and Runay\n\n“When choosing a business associate, I always look for reliability, dependability, and honesty. When choosing a product, it must have superior qualities for an economical value. Working with Thermo-Tech Windows has provided me a business relationship that meets all my expectations, both from a relationship and product perspective. It has been a pleasure doing business with you and we look forward to many transactions in the future.”\n\nJim Schmitz, CEO\nJames & Associates Development Co., Inc.\n\nJonny Mills - Avalon Homes\nHomeowner from St. Cloud, Minnesota\nJohn and Pat\nDenny and Runay\nJim Schmitz, CEO\n\nThermo-Tech Support\nCommitment to service excellence.\n\nLearn more\n\n                  \n\nAbout Thermo-TechCareersContact UsService Field ReportHome\n\n1120 38th Avenue NE • Sauk Rapids, Minnesota 56379\n\nPhone: 320-529-4012 • Toll-Free: 1-877-565-0159 • info@thermo-techwindows.com\n\nThermo-Tech® is a registered trademark of Thermo-Tech Windows and Doors LLC.\nCopyright © 2025.

The list of our competitors who can legitimately make the same claim is a short one…like zero.\n\nWith over 120,000 square feet between our five facilities and approximately 250 employees, either we’ll have what it takes to conquer the challenge, or we’ll figure it out.\n\nFrom here, you can learn more about both our Fabrication and Installation operations as well as see examples of our work.\n\nKENSINGTON GLASS ARTS INC\n2194 Urbana Pike\nIjamsville, MD 21754\n240-514-5200\n\n\n[addthis tool=addthis_horizontal_follow_toolbox]\nFabrication Services\nGlass Fabrication For Architects\nPlant Tour\nKGa’s Commercial Service Division\nGlass Installation Services\nPreconstruction\nContact Us\nKensington Glass Arts, Inc.\nThe Leading fabricator of architectural glass in the Washington-Baltimore Area.\n\nKensington Glass Arts (KGa), based in Ijamsville, Maryland and Sterling, Virginia, has officially completed the process of sunsetting their Contract Glazing Division.\n\nThis strategic move is aimed at concentrating all company resources and efforts on their Glass Fabrication Division, which has been highly successful since its establishment in 2002. The Glass Fabrication Division specializes in the fabrication of heavy tempered and laminated glass, catering to various aspects of the architectural industry. Their products include fabricated glass for kitchen and bath, architectural interior and exterior glazing systems, handrails, balustrades, and various commercial glazing applications.\n\nKGa has chosen to maintain the technical and engineering expertise they have developed over thirty-five years in the industry, which includes the installation of a wide range of glazing in commercial projects. This expertise has been restructured into what is now known as the Technical Sales Team. The role of this team is to enhance the company's fabrication and sales processes by providing complex glass and hardware packages, which include shower door hardware and various types of glass doors, as well as offering unique hardware to complement their glass sales.\n\nKGa's extensive experience as a commercial glazier allows them to offer unparalleled customer service and logistical support. They are committed to delivering high-quality, fabricated glass products with aggressive lead times to clients in the glazing, shower door, and architectural sectors on the East Coast. The company believes that by transitioning to a dedicated Glass Fabrication business model, they will be able to focus more effectively on their work, expand their geographical reach, and provide a level of service and support that is uncommon in the industry. This shift is expected to address common challenges such as lead times, logistics, and quality issues that are faced by glass shops, commercial glaziers, and glass wall dealers.\n\nFIND OUT MORE CONTACT US"

Our fiberglass grating products are created using high-quality polymers and fibers that enhance the surface’s strength and durability. We offer a variety of Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic products that are mostly used for different flooring systems.\n\n \n\nGatorGrate™\n\nSeasafe offers an exceptional one-piece Fiber Reinforced Plastic grating (FRP grating) that comes with standard colors, panels, and sizes such as 4’x12′, 3’x10, 3’x10′, 4’x8″, 5’x10′ and 2′ -0 1. Gator Grate is manufactured through a process of fiberglass roving with thermosetting resin systems.\n\nGatorgrate is a brand of molded fiberglass grating known for its exceptional one piece construction, and slip resistance surface. It is designed to provide a safe walking surface (gritted surface) in wet or oily conditions, making it ideal for use in industrial applications, oil and gas industry and commercial settings where slip and fall hazards are a concern.\n\nThe product is also available in different depths, meshes, and configurations. Some of the available top surfaces are grit top with embedded silica sand, meniscus with half-moon cross-section, and applied grit with an epoxy bond to meniscus top panels.\n\nThis construction guarantees that the body is smooth and flat, making it easier for walking. What’s unique about Gator Grate is that it is slip-resistant and durable with a high strength to weight ratio.\n\nRead More\nGatorDeck™\n\nSeasafe’s Gator Deck works as a power trio of strength, corrosion resistance, and structural integrity. We manufacture this product through a continuous molding procedure called pultrusion.\n\nThis process converts reinforced fibers and resin into Fiber Reinforced Plastic. The final product is in the form of geometric shapes that are solidified as they’re pulled through a heated steel die.\n\nThe product is not only slip-resistant but also self-draining with a two-part mechanical locking cross-rod. We can also create unique resin system according to the customers’ specifications. Conclusion, Seasafe’s Gator Deck, a marvel of modern engineering, stands tall as a testament to the perfect synergy achieved by combining strength, corrosion resistance, and structural integrity.\n\nThis innovative solution redefines industry standards, offering a harmonious trio of qualities that ensures longevity even in the harshest marine environments. GatorDeck™ is a premium brand of FRP grating (fiberglass grating products) known for its exceptional durability, cost effective and performance.\n\nRead More\nLadder Tray\n\nU.S. Coast Guard approved, Seasafe’s Ladder Tray Fiber Reinforced Plastic cable system can stay intact even in the harshest climatic conditions.\n\nWe can assure you that the material is rustproof and will never require painting as it has an ultraviolet exposure barrier. The Ladder Tray is one of the best fiberglass cable tray systems, created with precision and high-quality raw materials like vinyl ester, making it resistant to wind and saltwater.\n\nThe NEMA loadings of Ladder Tray are load-tested by NEMA FG-1 guidelines.

At Seasafe, the Ladder Tray is available in both vinyl ester and polyester resin system. Seasafe Ladder Tray also meets the requirements of ASTM D-635 and Class 1 Flame Rating.\n\nSeasafe Ladder Trays come in Gray (polyester resin) and Beige (vinylester resin); however, we do provide customized colors at the customers’ request.Ladder tray and fiberglass stair (fiberglass grating systems) are both types of cable management systems used in industrial and commercial applications.\n\nRead More\nChannel Tray\n\nA light duty pultruded tray system perfect for Instrumentation & electrical applications. Channel tray is commonly used in industrial settings, such as factories and power plants, where large quantities of electrical cables and wires need to be organized and protected. Fiberglass grating, on the other hand, is a type of flooring system that is used to provide a slip-resistant surface in industrial and commercial settings. Pultruded fiberglass grating and Channel Tray are both durable and corrosion resistance products made from fiberglass material, with the former used for industrial flooring and the latter for cable management in industrial and commercial settings. Channel tray is available in various sizes, designs like bar shape and configurations to accommodate different cable types and layouts.\n\nRead More\nANC Fencing\n\nSeasafe offers its number one Fiber Reinforced Plastic security product that will ensure your safety with a 20ft high beautiful fencing system.

Photos by Jill S. Markwood\n\n\nJay and Neal Brenner of Cycle System are constantly on the go. From ensuring their company is in compliance with an ever-growing list of environmental regulations and up to date on a multitude of legal issues to keeping track of the fluctuating markets for the recyclables they handle, the brothers have their work cut out for them. However, it is a challenge the two relish.\nKeeping Cycle Systems on the right path is no easy task. The challenge requires that the company not only stick to what it has done so successfully in the past but also expand into ancillary businesses, which can provide a source of scrap metal for the company as well.\n“We have to be innovative,” say Neal and Jay, president and CEO, respectively, of Cycle Systems.\nThe company, headquartered in Roanoke, Va., operates two main yards and seven feeder yards. One of Cycle Systems’ key assets is an auto shredder, which has been in operation for slightly more than seven years.\n\nScrap Metal and Beyond\nCycle Systems has established several new divisions, which, the two executives say, complement the company’s core scrap metals business.\nOne such division that has helped to keep Cycle Systems’ auto shredder supplied with auto hulks is a joint venture auto parts operation. The company also has recently launched the Vehicle Recycling Assistance Program (VRAP), which assists customers looking to scrap a vehicle in getting proper documentation and/or titles for their vehicles through the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), the company says. Through this service, Cycle Systems runs an automobile’s VIN (vehicle identification number) through DMV records to obtain clearance to purchase the vehicle.\nCycle Systems also operates a demolition division that is a source of additional recyclables to process and market.\nThe company’s renewal group consists of a trio of businesses: American Railroad Equipment LLC, a cyclical business that, for decades, has targeted the dismantling of railroad equipment; ARE Energy, which focuses on the assembly and packaging of transportable power plants using recycled, remanufactured and used parts; and its CSI Surplus, which resells excess inventory in liquidation sales and works with Cycle Systems’ demolition division to strip out breakers, bearings and other industrial equipment of value before demolition begins.\nWhile Cycle Systems has diversified its operations with these ancillary businesses, its core business remains processing scrap metals. Its auto shredder in Lynchburg, Va., is the focal point of the these operations. Jay says the company’s 98-by-104 shredder includes a “pretty sophisticated” downstream system and is powered by a General Electric locomotive engine rather than operating off the electrical grid, like so many other auto shredders.\nNeal says using a locomotive engine as a power source gives the company flexibility. The shredder is able to run on biodiesel fuel, more conventional diesel fuel or even natural gas. “The advantage is that we are not forced to run on the grid. We don’t have to shut down [the shredder] due to peak energy usage. We also don’t get stuck with high energy costs. We can run the shredder when we want to.”\nJay says the next step is to see if the motor will run on synthetic gas. To accomplish this, Cycle Systems is testing various fuels on a duplicate engine that mirrors the one used to run its auto shredder.\n\nCustomer Oriented\nCycle Systems’ roots extend back to 1916, when Joseph Brenner immigrated to the United States from Latvia. Brenner brought his brothers Jacob, Morris and Frank into his scrap and iron-peddling business in Hagerstown, Md.\nJacob, who went on to found Cycle Systems, migrated south, ending up in Virginia’s Roanoke Valley area. Udell Brenner succeeded Jacob, followed by Bruce and Terry Brenner. With Jay and Neal, the company is now under the leadership of the fourth generation of the Brenner family.\nNeal and Jay say being a Brenner does not guarantee a position with Cycle Systems. In fact, Neal says, his father made it known to him that before he could come to work for Cycle Systems he had to work somewhere else. For Neal, that meant selling computers and computer systems.\nWhen Neal finally approached his father about joining the company, he says, “I had to interview with many managers. It wasn’t because I was a family member that I was hired.”\nNeal has worked in various positions for the company. “I ran an operation and then another. I came back to Roanoke and moved up that way. I ran our IT department, went on to become vice president and finally president,” he says.\n\nBoth Neal and Jay say that in many ways Cycle Systems is a traditional scrap recycling facility, with operations that target ferrous and nonferrous metals. The company also handles nonmetallics and even solid waste for some clients.\nDespite its growth, Cycle Systems has made sure customer service remains front and center.\nBecause Cycle Systems is located in an area with significant competition from large and small recyclers alike, providing quality service allows the company to remain focused on its profitability, the Brenners say.\nNeal estimates 40 to 50 percent of Cycle Systems’ business comes from peddler trade, with the remainder split between commercial and industrial accounts. Relying so heavily on retail is a challenge, Jay and Neal say. “What we see with retail customers is that is they are very price conscious rather than being loyal to a particular business,” Jay adds.\nDespite the peddlers’ mindset, Cycle Systems understands the importance of maintaining a good rapport with customers. To ensure customer satisfaction, the company created a call center. “We take care of our customers and want to answer all their questions,” Neal says. “It is hard for the scale operators and cashers to pay attention to who is coming to the window.” The call center helps the company offer a level of customer service that it otherwise may not be able to provide.\nCycle Systems also competes with some of the largest scrap recyclers in the world for available tonnage. The company has focused on developing and growing its business in small to mid-sized cities rather than on establishing operations in larger cities.\n\n\nPeople Power\nCycle Systems, Roanoke, Va., takes great pride in the relationship it has nurtured with its employees. In the company’s 90-plus-year history, Neal says, it did not have to lay off an employee until the market collapse in late 2008/early 2009. During that time, the company had to make significant cuts to its employee ranks. Brothers Joe and Neal Brenner, CEO and president of Cycle Systems, say they still regret the move, though it was necessary.\n“We are proud of our people,” Jay says. “We are very diverse. There are lots of women in management roles—on-site mangers, transportation managers, our CFO. We also have many retired military personnel in our company. They come to us with a great deal of leadership skills, and we find that they are quick to pick up the scrap mentality and lingo.”\nBruce Brenner, Cycle Systems chairman, pushes the company’s management staff to get the right person in place, to diversify and to get ideas from different people within the company, Neal and Jay say.\n\nContinuous Challenges\nDespite targeting smaller cities, the company is not immune to the changing dynamics affecting the industry. “There used to be an advantage in that there was a high barrier to entry,” Neal says of the scrap industry. “It was hard to get into the business. However, we have definitely seen changes to that, with more competitors opening up.”\nThese new competitors aren’t just the large, multinational operations that have been snapping up assets, but also the “mom and pops” who are seeing opportunities in scrap metal, Neal says.\nWhile the Brenners say Cycle Systems invests significant capital to ensure it meets all its regulatory requirements, many of these smaller companies may avoid undertaking these costs, leaving companies such as Cycle Systems at a disadvantage. “We want to do the right things, while many of these ‘mom and pop’ places choose not to live with the regulations,” Neal says.\nPart of the problem is inadequate enforcement, Jay says.\nNeal and Jay say scrap metal theft and the possibility of more legislation affecting scrap recyclers is an ongoing problem. “There are days we sit here and ask if we need a compliance officer just to make sure we remain legal,” Neal says.\nChanging state and local regulations for buying scrap metals may mean Cycle Systems has to change its procedures to stay in compliance, he adds.\nJay says Virginia legislators are considering implementing tag-and-hold requirements for scrap yards. “When you talk about that you need to address the honesty of the customer. The material you receive often changes in its form. How do you determine that? Are you looking for trends in customers? Police are often at our site looking for stolen material. Tag and hold will not help.”\nNeal says often legislators treat scrap yard just like pawnshops. However, when dealing with 250 customers in a day, it can be impossible to keep incoming materials separate, he adds.\n\nDomestic Destinations\nIn addition to these various compliance issues, Cycle Systems needs to contend with the bread and butter of its business: buying and selling metals. The company has been successful by sticking with its domestic customers. Jay says practically 100 percent of the ferrous scrap Cycle Systems handles is shipped to domestic buyers. “We rarely ship ferrous material overseas,” he adds.\nJay says Cycle Systems is fortunate to have a number of consumers operating in proximity to its facilities.\nNeal adds, “Even though the majority of what we sell is domestic, we need to understand the whole global strategy and how that affects us. Also, as different companies get involved in the scrap industry and larger multinationals look to acquire their needed ferrous and nonferrous volumes, we will be challenged to stay competitive.”\nThe volatile nature of the global scrap industry has affected the way Cycle Systems operates as well. “You have to learn to manage your business when you handle those large swings,” Neal says. “We make sure to handle that by turning inventory. Don’t expose yourself to the risk if you don’t need to,” he advises.\nNeal says Cycle Systems tries to operate according to the view of COO Gene Suslowicz. The company buys material today, ships it to a processing yard tomorrow, processes the material on the third day and ships the material the following day. While this is its goal, the company can’t always accomplish it, he admits.\nWhile the company has benefitted from organic growth and acquisitions, there is no easy path. For those who say acquisitions are a quick way to expand, Jay says the infrastructure needs to be there for it to be successful. “A company has to put in the right equipment, and then you have to integrate it into your business,” he says. “To compete, we are always looking for getting the best productivity with the least cost.”\nWhen it comes down to it, the approach Cycle Systems takes to business is basic. According to Jay, integrity and honesty are foremost. “We put that above everything,” he says. “We treat employees with respect. And we make business decisions after a lot of analysis and understanding.”\n\n\nThe author is senior and Internet editor of Recycling Today and can be contacted at dsandoval@gie.net.\nPosted by Cycle Systems at 10:53 AM 1 comment: \nEmail This\nBlogThis!\nShare to X\nShare to Facebook\nShare to Pinterest\nLabels: metal, recycling, scrap metal\nLocation: 2580 Broadway Ave SW, Roanoke, VA 24014, USA\nTUESDAY, MARCH 6, 2012\nCycle Systems Community Involvement for 2012\n1st Quarter - Community Volunteerism.\n\nThe Roanoke Facility will provide opportunities at The Rescue Mission.\nSara Campanga, Site Manager for Cycle Systems Covington Site read to elementary school children at Boiling Spring Elementary on March 1st, 2012.\n\n\n\n\n2nd Quarter - American Cancer Society.\n\n3rd Quarter - JDRF.\n\n4th Quarter - American Heart Association.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPosted by Cycle Systems at 8:36 AM No comments: \nEmail This\nBlogThis!\nShare to X\nShare to Facebook\nShare to Pinterest\nLabels: American Cancer Society, American Heart Assocation, boiling spring elementary, community, JDRF, reading, recycling, school\nLocation: 2580 Broadway Ave SW, Roanoke, VA 24014, USA\nTHURSDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 2012\nCycle Systems welcomes artists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEWS RELEASE\n\n\nFor more information, contact:\nThomas Becher\ntba (the becher agency)\nPR + Advertising\n(540) 772-3942\ntbecher@tbtheagency.com\n\n \nCycle Systems Welcomes Artists\nNew program gives artists chance to buy scrap metal to make art \n\n\nCHARLOTTESVILLE, Va.

Many of our employees have been with the company for over 40 years, including company president Robert Wilson Jr.\n\nHaving been shaped by a rich tradition of long relationships with our customers, suppliers, and employees, Dare will continue to strive to offer quality products and friendly service in the years to come.\n\nOur basic philosophy is quite simple: to manufacture and provide quality products resulting in lasting relationships with our customers. Many of our customers have been with Dare for over 60 years.\n.. Read More »\n\nDare manufactures the majority of our products, ensuring the highest quality.

Our dedication is exhibited not only though the world class equipment manufactures we have decided to team up with but more prominently through the expert glass professionals that work at our state of the art facility in East Hanover, New Jersey\n\n \n\nPRODUCTS\n\nOpulux stocks some of the world’s best quality raw material glass and has the capability to store and process more than 45 diverse types of glass, ranging in all sizes and thicknesses. Through the use of high quality raw materials, we can ensure a superior level of quality assurance and consistency when delivering final product to our ever demanding clients.\n\nEQUIPMENT\n\n Investing in state of the art equipment was of utmost importance for Opulux upon formation. Accordingly, we have partnered solely with American and European machinery manufacturers who have proven themselves as industry leaders time and time again. This allows us to push the envelope with regards to producing excellent quality and precise end products clients can be proud to use.\n\nCAPABILITIES\n\nOpulux offers a wide range of services and capabilities to assist our clients with all of their glass fabrication needs from cutting to tempering and everything in between. Opulux is observant of the constant changes that effect the glass industry and accordingly adapt with times, always looking for opportunities in expanding our service lines to best serve our clients.\n\n \n\n \n\nInvesting In Only The Best Technology\n\nOpulux is dedicated to producing the flattest, most aesthetically pleasing glass for our customers. Our dedication is what motivated us to invest in the Glaston FC500 tempering line. This engineering masterpiece was designed to temper all types of glass but specifically high performance low-e glass. On an average tempering line low-e glass would have a significant amount of distortion and roller wave. We take pride in knowing that we are able to surpass the strict tolerances and high quality glaziers and architects expect. \n\nIn response to the demand for larger lites of glass, Opulux is equipped to temper glass up to 108\"x 144”  Come take a tour of our facility and let us show you what Opulux can do.\n\nMANUFACTURING RELATIONSHIPS DISTRIBUTING QUALITY\n\nOPULUX GLASS INC.\n905 MURRAY ROAD\nEAST HANOVER, NJ 07936\nEMAIL: ORDERS@OPULUXGLASS.COM\nTELEPHONE: (973) 795-0105\nFAX: (973) 795-0109\nHOURS: MONDAY-FRIDAY 8 AM - 5 PM\nName\n(required)\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail Address\n(required)\nSubject\n(required)\nMessage\n(required)\nSUBMIT\nOPULUX GLASS INC., 905 MURRAY ROAD, EAST HANOVER, NJ, 07936, UNITED STATES(973) 795-0105INFO@OPULUXGLASS.COM\n\nPowered by Squarespace"

We pride ourselves on upholding relationships with our loyal customers for 10, 20, 30, and even 40 years. This trust and support we provide to our customer base has been standard since 1932, and it has permitted HGW to grow and expand into the many fields of the glass industry.\n\nWe design, test and manufacture ballistic glass assemblies and transparent armor that help keep members of the U.S. military safe. Additionally, we provide a diverse range of security and architectural solutions to federal and state agencies, law enforcement, and the private sector.\n\nTo learn more about our capabilities and offerings, please contact us.\n\nHistory\n\nHawkins Glass (HGW) was in the wholesale glass manufacturing and distribution fields until February 2012. It manufactured and distributed many products to multiple markets, including: bullet resistant, tempered, laminated and insulated glass, mirrors, table tops and obscure glass. HGW serves the local area while also shipping many products worldwide.\n\nHawkins Glass is a limited liability corporation based in Virginia. It was founded in 1932 & relocated from Washington, DC to Marlow Heights, MD in 1965. Under the direction of new management in the 1980s, HGW achieved significant growth & eventually relocated again to Waldorf, MD.\n\nIn 1998, Eastern Moulding, HGW’s wholesale picture frame division, was sold to Larson Juhl. Following the sale, HGW moved to Springfield, VA and moved into the manufacturing field. The steady growth in sales and customers created a need for more equipment and warehouse space, so HGW designed and built a warehouse in Stafford, VA in 2005. In 2001 the company entered the government contracting space as a provider of ballistic and military products, and moved that division to Lorton, VA to better address the security requirements of its customers. As the ballistics division grew, the flat glass division remained in Stafford, VA until it was sold to Grey Mountain Industries in February 2012. Since then, HGW has focused exclusively on its ballistic and military product lines.\n\nHawkins Glass has built its reputation on its stellar customer service. It takes pride on maintaining relationships with customers for up to 40 years. The trust and support that HGW provides its customer base has been the foundation on which the company has grown and diversified into many fields within the glass industry.\n\nIn addition to the required training for safety and machinery use and operation, employees are provided with intensive training for their specific job duties. Exceptional employees are cross-trained to allow them to step into multiple positions.\n\nAll products are purchased from several suppliers so that short-falls in inventory are avoided. HGW tries to use small businesses for sub-contracted items provided that the companies meet HGW’s quality standards and production schedule. On average, 65% or more of HGW’s subcontracting goes to small businesses.\n\nCAPABILITIES\n\nFor more information, including a full list of our product offerings and capabilities, please contact us directly.\n\nMINE PROTECTED CLEARANCE VEHICLE (MPCV) BUFFALO A2\nCOUGAR MRAP 4x4\nCOUGAR MRAP 6x6\nFAMILY OF MEDIUM TACTICAL VEHICLES (FMTV)\nHUSKY MINE DETECTION VEHICLE\nRG-33 MINE-RESISTANT AMBUSH PROTECTED VEHICLE (MRAP)\nPEACE KEEPING SECURITY VEHICLE (PKSV)\nHMMWV WITH MARINE ARMOR KIT (MAK)\nCAIMAN MRAP\nDOD 1033 MILITARY SURPLUS PROGRAM\nCONTACT US\nP: (703) 339-2194\nF: (703) 339-2195\n9712 Gunston Cove Rd, Suite J\nLorton, VA 22079\nINQUIRIES\nFor general inquiries or requests for quotations, please contact us directly via email.\nCopyright Hawkins Glass\n\n"

His only products were a limited number of railroad lenses. The company has expanded to include every signal lens used in this industry, the Gate Keeper, the electronic bell, LED crossing lights, gate lights, gate arms, and Crossbucks.\n\nThe Gate Keeper was introduced to the industry in 1990 and has literally saved the industry millions of dollars by reducing the replacement of broken gates. The electronic crossing bell has no moving parts; its non-corrosive construction has saved the industry considerable costs also. We consider both products to be the most superior Gate Keeper and electronic bell available.\n\nWe keep all of our products at adequate inventory levels to supply your needs almost immediately. Your order placed with us today may be shipped to you tomorrow and certainly within a week.\n\nDon’t hesitate to contact us for additional information about these products, pricing and delivery.\n\nOur Products\nThe Gate Keeper\nRailroad Signal Lenses\nLED Highway Crossing Lights\nRailroad Crossbucks\nIncandescent Gate Lights\nLED Gate lights\nGate Arms\nLED Light Head\nElectronic Crossing Bell\nLight Bulbs\nTraffic Signal Lenses\nCONTACT US\nSee what our customers are saying about us:\n\nI am a railroad switch lamp collector and general signals has helped me complete several restorations.

Having the exterior color in the extrusion is a much better process than some of the other people using paint which has a tendency not to be consistent or more difficult to install. Their warranty on the impact glass is double what most of the factories offer. If we run into a complication on an installation, the support team from the factory has helped us clear us the problem and also showed us ways of avoiding those mistakes in the future. Their French door system has the best design pressures in the industry and can you go up to two panels eight feet wide 8 feet tall. In the last two years, it's the only company that will give us an ETA that's actually accurate.\n\nJim Dell\nstar\nstar\nstar\nstar\nstar\nstar_outline\nstar_outline\nstar_outline\nstar_outline\nstar_outline\nA Very Important Partner\n\nCustom Window Systems has been a very important partner for us for over 20 years. Recently, they have really been focused on delivery of their products with very few backorders. If they have to make an additional delivery, it is usually on the next truck. While some other manufacturers are adding to their lead times, Custom Window Systems has been able to decrease their lead time with production efficiencies. It is evident to me that their quality control team is looking over materials before they are shipped. The inside sales/customer service team led by Helen has always been very responsive to any request. Our Sales Rep, Michael, is very quick to respond to an email or phone call. He is very knowledgeable with not only their products, but those of other companies in the industry.

The reasons are many:\n\nLong and unreliable lead times that can cause them to miss construction deadlines\nThe belief that a luxurious look comes with a luxurious price tag\nNot wanting to buy from a competitor\nThe realization that doing it themselves is labor intensive and expensive\nThe local frame shop is not geared for new construction or remodeling\n\nIt doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nAt Precision Frameworks, we recognize these concerns.

      "textData": "ABOUT\nSERVICES\nPRODUCTS\nPROJECTS\nNEWS\nCONTACT\nCAREERS\n0\n1\n2\nAbout Us\n\n\n\nTempco Glass Fabrication launched our modest 45,000-square-foot facility in the heart of Flushing, New York, with one focus: to leverage our decades of experience in the glass and fenestration industry to become the premier Glass Professionals' Choice for local glaziers, glass shops, and manufacturers -- no matter how big or small. Our goal has always been to be a company that remains laser-focused on our customers and our employees, and despite having doubled our employee count and manufacturing space in the last year alone, we have always maintained the personality of being a modest family-operated business. This gives us the ability to remain nimble and flexible enough to satisfy the needs of all of our customers, as no customer is ever considered \"too demanding.\" Moreover, we have never shied away from making smart investments in state-of-the-art CNC and glass fabrication equipment to provide top-quality glass fabrication services to our customers, including cutting, notching, drilling, milling, and edging; and of course, let's not forget about our glass tempering furnace capable of providing SGCC-certified tempering services of thicknesses from 1/8\" and up.\n\n\nOur quality has been recognized by our customers and suppliers domestically and worldwide, and we are IGCC-certified to fabricate dual-sealed insulated glass units using a wide selection of high-performance low-e coatings proudly made in the USA, sourced from top float suppliers such as PPG, AGC, and Guardian. We also stock a variety of thicknesses of different glass types, including clear, tinted, low-iron (including Starphire), reflective, acid-etched, patterned, mirrored, laminated, and other high-performance MSVD and pyrolytic coatings.\n\n\nAt Tempco Glass, you're more than just a customer. You're a valued friend and partner. Please do not hesitate to contact our team at any time; better yet, stop by for a factory tour so that we can prove to you that you have a friend at Tempco Glass.\n\nCertifications\n\n\n\nMBE Certifications\n\nTempco Glass Fabrication has received certifications from the New York City Department and the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey of Small Business Services as a Minority Business Enterprise.\n\nSGCC-certified\n\nTempco provides glass tempering furnace capable of providing Safety Glazing Certification Council (SGCC) certified tempering services of thicknesses from 1/8\" and up.\n\nIGCC-certified\n\nTempco is IGCC-certified to fabricate dual-sealed insulated glass units using a wide selection of high-performance low-e coatings proudly made in the USA, sourced from top float suppliers such as Vitro, AGC, Guardian, and Pilkington.\n\nVitro Authorized Supplier\nGuardian Glass SunGuard Select Fabricator\nAGC Certified Processor\nIMPROVED LEAD TIMES\n\nWe’ve listened!

Our experienced staff understands your business – we’re local, so turnaround is fast, from quote to finished product. With value pricing and our state-of-the-art production equipment and techniques, Tempco consistently provides its customers quality glass products.\n\nVertical Milling and Drilling\n\nOur brand new state-of-the-art CNC Mill and Drill is capable of processing virtually any cut-out, regardless of complexity, using its multi-tool spindle for milling, drilling, countersinking, and arising. When coupled with our experienced technicians, we can process small and large-volume shower door orders, glass entrance door systems, display cases, and furniture set pieces.\n\nGlass Cutting & Washing\n\nOur new cutting table triples our current capacity. It cuts quicker than we can break. Precise cuts, every time. The fully automated CNC glass cutting table provides straight-edge and shape cutting, has edge deletion capability, and handles glass sheets up to 144\" x 100\". Our 8-brush glass washer and dryer system accommodates all glass types, including Low-E.\n\nEdge Polishing & Mitering\n\nOur vertical automated edge polishers accommodate large-size glass, rapid cycle times and considerable processing capacity. We offer flat polishing as well as mitered edges.\n\nNotching & Drilling Holes\n\nOur semi-automatic drilling equipment provides notches and holes up to 6 inches for all your installation needs, such as shower doors, glass railing, interior partitions and tabletops.\n\nInsulated Glass Units\n\nAside from offering quick lead times, Tempco is IGCC-certified to fabricate virtually any unit thickness, size, and glass configuration, including high-performance argon-filled double or triple pane units requiring high-performance soft-coat Low-E coatings, ranging from PPG-Vitro Solarban 60 to AGC Energy Select.\nWe also stock a large selection of spacers, muntins, and SDLs in finishes. Our standard units utilize desiccant-filled aluminum spacers and are dual-sealed with a PIB primary seal and a structural silicone secondary seal.\n\nGlass Tempering\n\nOur full convection tempering furnace can handle glass sheets up to 82\" x 128\", and from thicknesses of 1/8\" to 1/2\".\n\nProfessional Delivery\n\nTempco offers delivery service to jobsite and trade customer locations.

Our patented Signals Defense RF/IR Shielding window films  transforms ordinary spaces into secure spaces. Including transforming Conference rooms, offices, and data centers into secure spaces that meet TEMPEST standards for protecting electronic equipment from digital theft, accidental data leaks, and espionage.\n\n9\n\t\nABOUT US\n\nSignals Defense is a privately held, company based in Owings Mills, MD, USA. We protect information and people by creating secure work environments.\n\nSIGNALS DEFENSE – RF/IR SECURITY SOLUTIONS\n\nSignals Defense sets the benchmark in RF/IR window films and shielding materials for Secure Work Environments, including SCIFs (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities).

AND FOR ACME, BRICK IS ONLY THE BEGINNING. \n\nWhen Acme Brick was founded in 1891, it was customary for homes and buildings to be clad in a single type of material - wood, stone or, yes, Acme Brick. Buildings today may have as many as five different types of cladding. \n\nSo as always, Acme Brick is responding to the changing needs and preferences of our customers, though our Innovative Building Products division.\n\nWORLD CLASS CLADDING SOLUTIONS\nThin brick – 9 different lines including our own thinBRIK series\nNatural stone – including Acme’s exclusive Stonebrook line and the CUPACLAD wall system paired with natural slate\nPremier metal cladding from MAC Metal Architectural, and Quality Edge\nCeramic and terracotta cladding systems – Agrob Buchtal\nAdvanced high-pressure laminate panels, such as Pura NFC by Trespa\nHigh-density fiber cement from KØL USA\nPanel-based fastening systems, including our patented Fast Track System\nDuPont™ ArmorWall™ System - a 5-in-1 exterior wall assembly\nTECHNICAL GUIDANCE, SUPERIOR SERVICE\n\nA support team based at our Fort Worth headquarters stands ready to help: with design tips, shop drawings, and comprehensive technical assistance for every Acme and IBP product.

PUT YOUR PROJECT ON THE FAST TRACK\n\n\nMarketing lore is replete with brand names that were so popular they became generic terms. Brands like Kleenex (facial tissue), Coke (soft drinks), Frigidaire (refrigerators) all benefited from this brand recognition in the marketplace. Interestingly, this process also works in reverse, where a generic term can become a popular brand. Want an example?\n\nHYTECT – ENHANCED CERAMIC FACADES: USING THE POWER OF NATURE TO PROTECT COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS\n\nLead image: Self-cleaning and aesthetic Raiffeisen Forum, Mödling, Austria /Architects: X42 Team, Vienna, Austria / Photos: Rich Hiebl \n\n\nAN ANCIENT BUILDING MATERIAL WITH MODERN, BIOPHILIC BENEFITS: TERRACOTTA CLADDING\n\nPhoto credit (left to right): David Brossard, CC BY-SA 2.0 via Wikimedia Commons, Joe Mabel, CC BY-SA 3.0 via Wikimedia Commons, davidvives90/Pixabay,\n\nHOW “PASSIVE HOUSE” CONSTRUCTION SAVES ENERGY\n\n\nPhysicists Bo Adamson from Lund University in Sweden and Wolfgang Feist from the Institut für Wohnen und Umwelt in Germany had read the research, dating back to the 1970s, that suggested it was possible to construct a low-energy building that was designed to exploit passive solar technologies and establish a comfortable indoor temperature with a low-energy requirement for heating or cooling. In 1988 the two professors coined a German term to describe this process. It was “Passivhaus.” \n \n\nBUILDING OWNERS DISCOVER THE ADVANTAGES OF NATURAL SLATE: ONE OF THE BEST IS CUPACLAD\n\n\nWhile architects and contractors have recognized the benefits of rainscreen cladding for energy conservation for many years, savvy building owners are now asking about this product because it looks so great. In response, Acme Brick has added a premier rainscreen cladding line to its suite of products.\n\n\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND CONSTRUCTION: HOW ARCHITECTS AND BUILDERS ARE HARNESSING THIS AMAZING TECHNOLOGY\n\n \n\nHOW A “JOB” BECAME A CAREER: ED WATSON’S 40 YEARS WITH ACME BRICK COMPANY\n\nTHE SPECTACULAR LOOK OF STONE WITH EASY INSTALLATION: CORONADO STONE\n\nMany home buyers love the natural look of stone but wince a little at the cost of this classic building material. This has led to an increase in the popularity of stone veneer, and one of the best is Coronado Stone, available from Acme Brick.\n\nCoronado architectural stone veneer can be used to greatly enhance the look and feel of a wide range of projects, from exterior walls to interior accent walls, kitchen backsplashes to outdoor entertainment spaces, and any other spot that can benefit from the timeless character of stone.\n\n\nAS MORTGAGE RATES LEVEL OFF, HOMEBUYERS ARE GIVING SUSTAINABILITY ANOTHER LOOK\n\n\nThere was a time in the not-so-distant past when the word “sustainability” almost never came up in conversations between potential home buyers and their builders. We live in a different world now. \n \nConsumer surveys have shown renewed interest on the part of home buyers in sustainability. Why? A sustainable home respects not only the planet but also the homeowner’s pocketbook. Here’s a checklist for discussing sustainability with your clients. \n\nNEW HOME BUYERS WANT SAFETY AND LOW MAINTENANCE: BRICK CONSTRUCTION HAS BOTH\n\n\nResidential and commercial builders have first-hand experience with the durability, low maintenance, and safety of brick construction. Plus, the consensus among fire fighters is that a home or commercial building constructed of brick retards fire better than any other material. Even in the most destructive fires, the lives of residents and the people who must fight these fires can be saved, and the damage to the building can often be mitigated.\n \n\nWHAT’S THE SECRET SAUCE FOR BUILDERS AND INVESTORS OF RESIDENTIAL RENTAL PROPERTIES? DURABLE CONSTRUCTION.\n\nMany of those FOR SALE signs that were once everywhere in suburban neighborhoods have been replaced by signs offering the property FOR RENT. Whether homes are in recently completed communities or more mature neighborhoods, homes that are built to be rental properties are on the radar screens of builders and investors.  \n \nThis presents both challenges and opportunities for homebuilders.\n \n\nMULTIPLE GENERATIONS LIVING UNDER ONE ROOF: HOW HOMEBUILDERS ARE ADJUSTING\n\n\nAccording to census data, there were 6 million multigenerational households in the U.S. in 2020, up from 5.1 million in 2010. These are households that include two or more adult generations, or grandparents and grandchildren younger than 25. While many cultures and ethnic groups (e.g., Hispanic, Asian) have always embraced this extended family living arrangement, they are now being joined by all other groups.\n \nBased on this trend, homebuilders are taking a closer look at offering floor plans that allow for greater flexibility.\n\nWHY YOUR CLIENTS ARE ASKING FOR A “HEALTHY HOME”- ANTIBACTERIAL TILE CAN HELP\n\n \n\nDIGITAL TOOLS FOR ARCHITECTS AND BUILDERS FROM ACME BRICK\n\n\nWith so many new products being added to Acme Brick’s inventory, architects and builders needed a convenient way to access their specifications, colors, and styles. Digital product brochures, catalogs, case studies, and other building and design resources have now been added to the site, dramatically increasing the accessibility of all product offerings. \n \n\nYOUR CLIENTS WANT TO ENTERTAIN OUTSIDE EVEN WHEN IT’S CHILLY. KEEP THEM COZY WITH A PATIO HEATER\n\n\nOutdoor entertaining has never been hotter, even when it turns colder.\n \nFresh air with a few friends and family is certainly conducive to a great time, and nothing tastes better than grilled meat and vegetables. However, what about those times in the fall and winter when “baby, it’s cold outside?” \n \n\nACME BRICK: YOUR SOURCE FOR STUNNING WROUGHT IRON DOORS\n\n\nSince ancient times, wrought iron has been a popular addition to homes and public buildings. When this metal is used for doors, the designs and colors of this material make a design statement that suggests richness and timelessness. For builders who want to add an elegant component to brick construction, wrought iron is an excellent choice.\n\nJOHN BREWER IS THE NEW GENERAL SALES MANAGER FOR ACME BRICK IN TEXAS\n\n\nBuilders who specify Acme Brick have another ally at the company in the new General Sales Manager for Texas. It’s John Brewer, a man who started his career as a residential home builder. Acme announced this promotion recently, and Brewer joins a long list of talented construction experts to hold this position in the company's more than 130 year history.\n \n\n , \nTHE 5 WAYS MAC METAL SIDING TURNED DISASTER INTO DAZZLING FOR THE EXTERIOR OF A TEXAS OFFICE BUILDING\n\n\nWhen they designed the ENT building in Fort Worth, Texas, the architects from the highly regarded firm of 97w did what great designers do: They spent weeks researching construction materials for the exterior facade of the building with the idea that it would make it stand out among the other buildings in the rapidly growing Clearfork area.\n\nHOUSTON’S GULF BUILDING CONSTRUCTED IN 1927 OF ACME BRICK: STANDING THE TEST OF TIME\n\n\nOne of the most magnificent examples of commercial buildings designed in the “Art Deco” style was constructed of brick manufactured by Acme Brick. The Gulf Building is still a “show stopper” almost 100 years after it was built.\n \n\nWHY YOUR CLIENTS MIGHT BE ASKING FOR SUSTAINABLE BUILDING PRODUCTS\n\n\nAs with many trends in residential construction, the term “sustainability” has gone from a buzzword used by a small number of people to the mainstream of new homebuyers. Why? One word: economics.\n \n\nCLIENTS WANT TO BUILD A VACATION HOME, BUT IT’S LOCATED IN A HURRICANE ZONE\n\nWhen clients find a lovely piece of coastal property and decide they want to build a vacation home, a red flag often goes up for builders. To be specific, two red flags with a black square in the middle of each is the warning for a hurricane! \n \n\nAFTER MORE THAN 130 YEARS, THE COMPANY BUILT WITH BRICK IS STRONGER THAN EVER\n\n\nOn April 17, 1891, businessman George E. Bennett chartered a company known as the Acme Pressed Brick Company. But not even a visionary like Bennet could image what was to come. By the mid-20th century, his company --- since renamed Acme Brick --- would become the largest American-owned brick manufacturer.\n\nFOR RESIDENTIAL OR COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS: 5 REASONS TO PICK MAC METAL ARCHITECTURAL SIDING\n\n\nWhether it's the heat of the blazing sun in the Southwest or the humidity and moisture in the Southeast, weather can wreak havoc on the exterior of any building — residential or commercial. This is why architects across the United States are rethinking their old decisions about cladding and choosing MAC Metal Architectural Siding.\n \n\nA HOMEBUILDER CHECKLIST: 10 PREMIUM PRODUCTS YOUR CLIENTS WILL LOVE\n\n \n\nART DECO IS HOT AGAIN AND SO IS GLASS BRICK\n\n Art Deco, a design trend that first gained popularity in the 1920s, has regained popularity, and we’ve noticed that our customers, who are architects, builders, and interior designers, are thinking outside the glass box. Glass block and brick are hot again, and this trend is being driven by the consumer’s appreciation of the natural radiance of light.\n\nHOW THINBRIK CAN REVITALIZE THE LOFT LOOK\n\nThe “loft look” got its start when manufacturers moved their operations from urban city centers to less expensive suburban areas starting in the 1950s. This left warehouse space available for redevelopment into living and working spaces for artists, writers, and other knowledge workers who loved the large rooms, exposed brick, low rent, and high-energy lifestyle these spaces provided.\n\n\nFAST-MOVING RESIDENTIAL FIRES ARE OFTEN FED BY VINYL SIDING— HERE ARE 2 PRODUCTS TO HELP STOP THIS\n\nIn the past 50 years, the economics of home construction have changed dramatically. When vinyl siding and synthetic insulation materials were introduced in the 1960s, as a substitute for traditional brick and wood, home builders found their costs were reduced dramatically. In recent years, it is estimated by trade associations that homes wrapped in vinyl siding and synthetic insulation are purchased by 33 percent of new home buyers.\n\nibp@brick.com\n1.800.932.2263\nCopyright 2025 Acme Brick Company.

From the very beginning of a project's development we help our clients pair the right product to each application. Once the project starts, we manage the process from shop drawings through procurement and finally installation which ultimately keeps projects within budget and on time.\n\nTechnologically Driven\nAt Burgess Snyder we are constantly looking for ways to improve our processes with the goal of increased efficiency without sacrificing quality. Our field superintendents carry tablets for note taking and cloud-based document reference. We have invested in a RhinoFab 900 system to streamline the storefront and curtain wall fabrication process. Our office maintains close to a 90% paper free environment. All of these investments have allowed us to focus more on the project and less on the paper.\nLow Financial Risk\nWe have been in business for over 70 years and have developed strong relationships with our bank, bonding company, and insurance companies. Because we pay promptly, our suppliers give our projects their full attention and are very responsive to our requests. We have proven that we have what it takes to handle the financial responsibility to all parties involved with the projects we undertake.\nAbout Burgess Snyder\n\nOwnership history:\n\nBurgess Snyder Industries began in 1948 when Jesse Burgess and Gustav Snyder formed Burgess Snyder Window Company. The new company sold storm windows and awnings from a small rented office in Norfolk, VA. In 1951 Jesse Burgess left the company but the business was established by then so the name remained the same. Gus Snyder died in 1969 and in 1971 Larry Vaughan bought the company from Mr. Snyder’s estate, keeping the Burgess Snyder name. In 1972, the company name was changed to Burgess Snyder Industries to better reflect the diverse range of products and services the company offered. In 1977, the company moved operations to it’s current facility located on Baker Road in Virginia Beach, VA. By 1993, Larry Vaughan had transferred ownership to his children, Tom Vaughan and Linda Sawyer. Tom Vaughan, Tom Johnson and Linda Sawyer owned and worked in the organization for better than 30 years each and witnessed tremendous growth during that time. In 2011, ownership was transferred to the current, third geration team of Chris Johnson, Kelly Kesler and Randall Vaughan.\n\nOperations history:\n\nBurgess Snyder formed initially as a manufacturer and installer of residential storm windows, storm doors and awnings. Manufacturing operations were carried out in a facility on Ballentine Blvd. in Norfolk, VA. In 1977, the company moved to the current location on Baker Road in Virginia Beach, VA. Soon after the move, the decision was made to stop manufacturing products in-house and instead sell pre-manufactured products from a select group of vendors. This decision allowed Burgess Snyder to focus more on customer service and develop quality installation crews.\n\nOnce manufacturing was phased out, the company primarily focused on providing replacement windows, doors, storm product and patio enclosures to the residential market. Since Norfolk is home to the world’s largest Navy base, it wasn’t long before Burgess Snyder was called on to provide services on commercial projects – specifically buildings at the various local government and military facilities. Two departments within the company were established to service each segment of the market since the residential and commercial customers have very different needs. Within the commercial department, an estimating and drafting team was created so all bids, shop drawings and submittals could be controlled in house. The commercial side of the business continued to grow allowing Burgess Snyder the resources and skills to complete larger and more complex projects. By the late 1980’s, the commercial department became the driving force of the company. For more than 20 years, Burgess Snyder Industries operated both the residential and commercial departments, each having their own management, office and installation teams but the market changed and so in 2007 the residential side of the operation was closed. Now, Burgess Snyder has 100% of it’s resources focused on commercial projects and provides sales and installation of the following architectural products for new construction and retrofit:\n\narchitectural aluminum windows\naluminum storefront\naluminum curtain wall\naluminum entrances\ntranslucent panels\nmirrors\nskylights\narchitectural sunshades\nglass canopies\naluminum canopies\nglass entrances\nblast windows, storefront and curtain wall\nhurricane impact windows, storefront and curtain wall\nLatest News\nContract Awarded for City of Virginia Beach Renovation of Municipal Building 2\nContract Awarded for City View II Apartments\nContract Awarded for P1120 Mariner Skills Training Center\nContract Awarded for Polytrauma Integrative Rehabilitation Clinic\nProfessional Associations\nContact Us\n\n560 Baker Road\nVirginia Beach, VA 23462\nphone: 757-490-3131\nfax: 757-490-1653\nestimating@burgess-snyder.com\nVirginia SWaM certified small\n\n© Copyright 2025.

Gillinder specializes in pressed and custom molded, clear and colored glass products “Made in the USA” from both open (Gillinder-owned) and private (customer-owned) molds.\n\nGillinder is a world leader in the manufacture of optical filter glass. Current products include PAR lenses, convex covers, Fresnel lenses, vapor tight and explosion-resistant globes, domes, cylinders, industrial globes, sight lenses, NVIS-compatible filters and contoured covers. Custom shapes can also be engineered and produced.\n \n\n Established in 1861\n\nTrusted Source for Glass Development Projects\n\n50% Marketshare of Airfield Lighting Glass in the USA\n\nOpen Mold Catalog\n\nIn addition to producing as much as 50% of the glass components for airfield runway lights for the US market, Gillinder provides products for lighting and other applications for many industry segments (both domestic and international) including aerospace and defense, architectural, commercial, industrial, landscape, theatrical, and transportation.\n\nOur chemists and engineers work with customers to assist in the design and development of custom glass products. Using multiple day tanks and pots, as opposed to continuous flow manufacturing techniques, Gillinder is able to produce multiple product shapes of different colors each day to meet each customer’s specific requirements. But, perhaps even more importantly, it allows us to serve a customer’s needs throughout their products' life cycle from limited introductory quantities, to full maturity production runs, and then heritage volumes.\n\nGillinder is proud of its rich heritage as a US glass manufacturer and its long standing (in some cases decades old) relationships with its customers. We look forward to continuing and building upon our reputation as a world leading manufacturer of technical molded glass products. If you are already a customer, thank you, and we look forward to hearing from you again. If you are not yet a customer, please contact us today so we may begin to provide the solution to your glass needs.\n\n© 2023 by Gillinder Brothers, Inc. \n51 Erie Street, Port Jervis, NY 12771\nEmail: info@gillinderglass.com\nPhone: 845-856-5375"

Our exclusive GRIDWALK™ systems offer the highest quality product available on the market today. FRP is used in a variety of Residential, Commercial, and Industrial settings from Oil and Offshore, Chemical Processing Facilities, Food Processing Plants to Pedestrian Bridges, Decks & Walkways. Our engineers are ready to assist you with your project needs. From supplying panels to turn-key projects, we are the FRP experts!\n\n \n\nMOLDED FIBERGLASS GRATING\n\nAmerican Grating's GRIDWALK™ Molded FRP Grating is constructed in one-piece, using reinforced polyester or vinyl ester resin and continuous interwoven fiberglass strand. This gives it multi-directional strength and allows for fabrication such as holes, cut-outs, without losing any structural integrity. It's used for flooring systems, walkways, trenches, platforms, stairs and much more. Customers can choose from a variety of sizes, such as 4' x 12', 4' x 8', 3' x 10', 5’ x 10’ and thicknesses such as 1\", 1-1/2\", 2”. Molded grating is easy to fabricate. You can custom fabricate or we can fabricate panels to size for you.\n\n \n\nPULTRUDED FIBERGLASS GRATING\n\nAmerican Grating's GRIDWALK™ Pultruded FRP Grating is ideal for longer spans and slightly lower in cost than Molded Grating. Its high load bearing strength makes it uniquely popular for spanning long distances. GRIDWALK™ grating uses a two part locking cross rod and features powerful uni-directional strength. The individual bars are made of glass roving and glass mat which gives it its strength. A surfacing veil provides high corrosion resistance. Used for flooring systems, walkways, trenches and platforms, customers can choose from a variety of sizes such as 3', 4' or 5' wide by 8', 10', or 20' lengths. Standard thicknesses are 1\", 1-1/2\", and 2\", I bar or T bar are available.\n\nCHEMICAL RESISTANCE GUIDES      RESIN SELECTION GUIDE      U.S. COAST GUARD APPLICATIONS      CASE STUDIES\n  \n\nCOMPANY PROFILE CONTACT US REQUEST CATALOG REQUEST QUOTE\nCopyright © 2025 American Grating\nAll Rights Reserved.

The open protocol allows the micro controller to read back these data and to run any color algorithm. It also allows to read back a temperature value to optimize this color algorithm. OSIRE TM E3731i is compliant with all known patents and rights in countries with an automotive production footprint. In particular, neither rights in terms of temperature compensation within the LED nor SPI communication with controllers inside an LED are affected.\nDetails and Datasheet\nOSRAM EVIYOS® HD 25 gen1, KEW GBCLD1U\nams OSRAM offers with EVIYOSTM HD25 gen1 a benchmark for intelligent HD headlamp solutions with 19.200 individual controllable pixels (aspect ratio 1:3).

We are so confident in the materials we utilize that all of the hardware we install comes with a limited LIFETIME replacement warranty. The occurrences of our handles rusting, the finishes tarnishing or hinges falling apart is slim to none! If in the rare occurrence this were to happen to your Frameless Shower Door and you are the original purchaser of the installation, at no cost to you we would exchange the effected hardware. \n\n \n\n\nOUR PROCESS\n\n \n\n\nIt all starts with a FREE in-home estimate. We will evaluate the area you would like your new Frameless Shower to be installed and then start the design phase. Our design professionals will work with you to create the perfect dream design and layout. With their expertise and innovative creativity they are able to maximize the functionality of your entire bathroom and present a stunningly beautiful design for your glass shower enclosure. Our team is able to present designs and   dramatic accents that others may never consider.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOur next step is taking measurements of your bathroom and designing and cutting each piece of glass individually. While bathrooms are typically similar to each other, we understand there are subtle differences so we customize each piece to ensure it fits perfectly. Our expert technicians fabricate all pieces in-house, so holes are drilled and notches are cut out right in our facilities. \n\n \n\n\nOnce the glass pieces have been fabricated they are ready to be tempered for safety and strength (this process is required by code for all shower enclosures). Tempered glass (commonly referred to as safety glass) is considerably stronger than un-tempered or annealed glass and in the rare case it breaks, will shatter into small safer pieces. To temper the glass we put it through a process where we heat it to over 600 °C and then rapidly cool it with high-pressure air. Once the tempering process has begun the glass can no longer be modified in any way.  Upon request we can add a logo to a glass piece indicating it has a certification of tempering (this may be helpful for code officials). \n\n \n\n\nInstallation is our last step; it is clean, simple and relatively quick. Depending on the type of enclosure, it could take at most 2-3 hours. All of our technicians at Superior Showers™ are certified to install our glass and hardware; they are also happy to answer any questions and educate you on your new Frameless Glass Shower. Once the installation is complete you will have a gorgeous new bathroom. \n\n \n\n\nSERENITY SERIES \n\n \n\n\n\n\nMake your bathroom feel even larger with a Serenity Frameless Shower!   \n\n \n\n\nA minimal amount of hardware is needed, enhancing the open look of your Frameless Shower.

Our solar eclipse glasses are completely safe and made with a scratch resistant black/silver polymer that filters out 100% of harmful ultraviolet rays, 100% of infrared rays, and 99.99% of intense visible light.\n\nA common myth regarding solar eclipses is that a pair of sunglasses is sufficient to protect you from the harmful rays to which your eyes will be exposed. Sunglasses alone are not sufficient eye protection in this situation. If you look directly at an eclipse, it can burn your retina in a matter of seconds, resulting in permanent damage. The solution is to wear special eclipse glasses that are backed by a reputable organization, such as the American Astronomical Society (AAS). All paper eclipse glasses sold by 3D Glasses Online carry this certification.\n\nLet American Paper Optics be your 3D solution provider for all things 3D related!

For me this is driven by 3 key factors: honesty, integrity, and ownership, even when the products are not performing as they should. Twelve months ago, Larry Lindland (President & CEO) and I sat down with his new salesman Paul Black (Regional Sales Manager) for introductions and to discuss a previous failed coolant trial.\n\nLarry opened the conversation up by owning his teams’ failures and asked what his team needs to do better. Over the last year, Paul and the LaPel team has delivered on every key point of our meeting and has worked to deliver a specialized product that will help to optimize the running conditions at my facility. From after-hour and weekend support to face-to-face meetings for the validation of their products, to onsite prep and management of products, LaPel left no rocks unturned. The buy-in to the success of their customers with quantitative results, shows the passion each member of the team has for their products and customers.\n\n-Adam, Senior Production Specialist, major Automotive Glass Manufacturer\n\nI am convinced this [MSIL-100] is a great product for anti-skid application and I think you will like it also. Not planning on going back to any of the previous products we have used over the years.\n\n- Mike Spence\n\nprev\nnext\nCONTACT US\nFind an Effective Solution\nWork with our team of experts to not only find the right products that align with your needs, but to receive the ongoing support you deserve.\nFirst Name*\nLast Name*\nEmail*\nPhone*\nMessage*\nConsent*\n By submitting this form, I agree to LaPel Solutions’s Privacy Policy.*\nCaptcha"

I honestly expected it to be cold when I went to take a sip and was pleasantly surprised. This is hands down going to be my go to cup for my coffee and other hot beverages. I can honestly say that I am a happy customer.\n\nAngie\n\nStunning absolutely love it would order again and buy as gifts\n\nCustomer\nExcellent Customer Service!\n\nI ordered two cups and the company accidentally sent me their new water cup instead of this cup. The water cup is really nice and similar shape to the one I ordered. I really liked the way it felt when holding it. I reached out to customer service and in less than an half and hour I got a response. I was able to send them a photo of the item sent and it was immediately taken care of. They even gifted the water cup to me for accidentally sending it. I had already reordered the original cup to try and get it by Christmas as well as another because I was so impressed by what I had been sent. Without me asking he corrected my order made the cup I hadn’t receive free in my order. He made sure they sent out my correct cup the next day and I received it in time for a Christmas gift. I was so impressed by their customer service you have a life long customer! Thank you Nate!! They arrived today while writing the review. What wonderful cups! I love the shape . The flat sides make it easy to hold. I have a MyBevi cup from 10 years ago I still use today. I have others but they never worked as well as MyBevi cup. It has held up so well that when my husband wanted to buy me a coffee cup for Christmas there was only one place I wanted to order from. My older cup has the wide slide and I love it because it’s easy to clean and removable. The new cup has the wide sliding top as well. I know my cup has held up so wonderfully for at least 10 years. I expect the same from my new cups. My husband did order a Yeti cup while I secretly ordered him a MyBevi cup for Christmas. The funny thing was he didn’t feel it kept his coffee hot for long enough and their customer service never got back to him. I can’t wait to gift him this coffee cup Christmas Morning. He is going to be thrilled. Thank you for everything. This company is the best.\n\nSascha Castro\nBest Coffee cup!\n\nI have used these cups for years. When my husband asked which cup to get me for Christmas and he suggested something other than a MyBevi cup I said no. I ordered this one for myself and another for him. He got his Yeti cup and the first day told me it wasn’t staying hot long enough. Mine came and I was overjoyed with style, color and design. It is easy to hold and the loop on the cup is a bonus because my other one didn’t have this. 10/10 and when I received my cup I ordered 2 more. The deal was too good to pass up.\n\nSascha Castro\nINNOVATION NOT IMITATION!\n\nAt MyBevi, we craft exceptionally made products, created to be as unique as you are and to go with you wherever your life takes you.

For use in industrial environments such as satellites, production machines or measuring instruments, it is particularly important that our products can withstand harsh conditions such as extreme temperatures, vacuum, vibrations, shocks, and the like. In medical technology, on the other hand, sensitive diagnostic equipment and surgical instruments require above all ease of handling, safety and sterilizability.\n\nTo the markets\n\nNews\n17.01.2025\nHigh performance for Space vacuum applications\n\nWe are excited to announce the latest innovation in our AVIM® product family: the Mini AVIM® PSt adapter, designed specifically for high-power…\n\nRead more\n14.01.2025\nIntroducing Ultra-Low Loss Fiber Optic Connectors\n\nDIAMOND SA has set a new benchmark in fiber optic connectivity with the development of its ultra-low loss (ULL) fiber optic connectors.

Welcome to bkr. If you’re wondering what the big deal is, why that one friend of yours is so obsessed with a glass water bottle, and how life could possibly be better on the other side of this velvet rope, you’re in the right place. This is where we’ll tell you a little bit more about why we’re not just a glass water bottle and why you just found your hydration soulmate and the thing that’s about to become the best thing you’ve ever owned. First, definition and pronunciation:  bkr /beak·er/ˈbēkər/ noun 1) the endlessly refillable, beautifully sustainable, original cult favorite glass water bottle (named after the glass container from chemistry class); 2) the very first ever lip balm water bottle (the “kiss kit”), and; 3) dishwasher safe, holds no scent, clean, clear, loved. But WHY SO LOVED? You kind of have to own one to understand. bkr is a magical accumulation of little details that together feel like luxury. It’s like the perfect t-shirt of water bottles. It’s soft and pretty, it feels right and fits right, you want it in every color, it’s effortless, you can’t help but love it, and it becomes an extension of you. Wait so, why did we make a vegan lip balm in Paris, and why did we engineer a special cap to snap it to the top of your bkr? Because our lips were dry despite owning every lip product known to man, we knew we’d kill it, and we knew it would become our next most treasured invention. We don’t release anything that isn’t perfection. Btw, we’re also a community of good people who care about others. We hope you’re here for it. Life gets better on this side of the velvet rope.\n\nWHAT'S NEW\nBESTSELLERS\nKITS & SETS\nWAREHOUSE SALE\nGIFT CARDS\nSHOP ALL\nREVIEWS\nFAQ\nBLOG\nREWARDS\nEMAIL & SMS SIGN UP\nCONTACT US\nABOUT US\nBRAND AMBASSADOR PROGRAM\nCAREERS\nCORPORATE/CUSTOM\nWHOLESALE\nRETURNS/REFUNDS\nSHIPPING\nSHIPPING PROTECTION POLICY\nSHIPPING PROTECTION CLAIMS\nWARRANTY\nTERMS OF SERVICE\nPRIVACY POLICY\nDO NOT SELL MY INFORMATION\nACCESSIBILITY\nACCESSIBILITY WIDGET\nINSTAGRAM\nFACEBOOK\nTIKTOK\nYOUTUBE\nPINTEREST\n\n© 2025 bkr All Rights Reserved\n\nYOUR CART\nLogin\nClose Cart\nYOUR CART IS EMPTY!\n\nAdd your favorite items to your cart.\n\nShop Now"

As a result we were the first company to offer a standard catalog range of spiders and rotules for structural glazing. Our classic line has evolved to include glass wall claddings, clamp fittings, tensions rods, and more.\nLEARN MORE\nINTERIOR SYSTEMS (DÉCOR)\nThe Décor product line has evolved from simple point fixed glass connections to many types of all glass sliding and swing doors.  The components compliment modern interiors but can also be just as at home in classical architectural renovations. The connections are very modular which allows for almost infinite possibilities.\nLEARN MORE\nBALUSTRADES & RAILINGS\n\nOriginally considered a part of our Decor line of products the SABCo (SADEV Balustrade Concepts) has evolved into a line of it’s own.  We offer a range of point fix guardrails and railing components as well as our new SABCo aluminum base shoe system.\nLEARN MORE\n\nCUSTOM FABRICATION\nAt SADEV USA we have our own fabrication, machining, and finishing facility to produce anything ranging from small precision machined parts to large structures that can be delivered to job sites.

Entliss in 1922, City Sign Service, Inc. has been providing signage and lighting solutions for the Delaware Valley and beyond. Originally located  in a three story brick building at 1306 Callowhill Street in Philadelphia, Entliss grew the company behind his skills as a designer, draftsman and artist. In 1989 Entliss decided to retire from the signage business and he sold City Sign to its current ownership, the Carson family.\n\nThe Carsons moved the company to Ambler, and then eventually to its current location in Horsham, Montgomery County, in 1994.\n\n \n\nPLEASE VIEW OUR VINTAGE SIGN GALLERY\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\n\n\n\nWho We Work For\n\nMONUMENTS\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nCABINET SIGNS\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nFCO LETTERS\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nCANOPIES / AWNINGS\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nCHANNEL LETTERS\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nPRINTING & VINYL\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nPYLONS\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nSPECIALTY LIGHTING\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nPOST & PANELS\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nSPECIALTY\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nWAYFINDING\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nCOMPLIANCE SIGNS\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\n\n\nFOR A SERVICE REQUEST PLEASE INQUIRE HERE.\nPLEASE CONTACT US.

Our products are manufactured exclusively in our plant located in suburban Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. We employ opticians, scientific glass blowers, tool and die specialists, mechanical engineers, and other specially trained technicians specific to our operations.\n\nWhile we maintain an independent quality assurance department, every individual involved in manufacturing at Spectrocell is trained for quality performance. Statistical process control over many years has resulted in highly precision products and extremely low rejection rates. Finally, we are committed to a process of continuous improvement of our operations, including timely and responsive service.\n\nAll of us at Spectrocell are very aware of the importance of your spectrophotometer tests. Our extensive experience and dedication to quality and service ensures you, the user, of the best possible results. We also take pride in the service we provide to our customers; your ultimate satisfaction with us is what keeps us in business. Over 60 years of continuous production is, we believe, a testament to our dedication and expertise.\n\nSpectrocell is the only US-based company still making standard spectrophotometer cells. We have a quick turnaround time on all stocked items, many shipping same or next day. All of our products are fully fire-fused, so you never have to worry about parts disassembling in expensive spectrophotometer machines. Remember that when you deal with Spectrocell you are dealing with the actual manufacturer, not a sales rep or a middleman; this can save you both time and money.

We are so glad that we reached out to them, and cannot say enough good things about our experience! We worked directly with Jason. He skillfully helped us to discover what we wanted and needed for our home. He also worked very closely with our roofing company to ensure the installation was perfect. We love our Skylights and the service we received. Our family room is so much more comfortable with the frosted glass to block the heat but not the light and a manually opening skylight to improve ventilation. I highly recommend Tam Skylights to anyone looking to update or add Skylights to their home or business!\n\nBRIAN AND MAGGIE, SOUTH SEATTLE\n\nWe have replaced many failed units from other manufacturers over the years with Tam Skylights. I always tell my customers with confidence that properly installed Tam Skylights do not leak.\n\nJOHN BERGIN, PRESIDENT OF BERGIN ROOFING INC.\n\nI had a very large 6 X 12 deck skylight made by Tam in West Seattle. There are 5 wood structural house beams under the 5 panel skylight that needed to be perfectly in-line with the skylight panel framing in order to have a nice visual look from the deck looking up. Jason (super good guy) came out 3-4 times to talk, bid, measure and double measure to make sure it was perfect. It was perfect in the beams alignment to the 5 panel framing. Excellent quality, service and pricing. We couldn't have been more pleased from start to finish!\n\nSCOTT, SOUTH SEATTLE\n\nIt has been a privilege for us to partner with TAM Skylights. We have worked side by side on numerous projects large and small creating lasting memories for our clients. TAM Skylights will go above and beyond for you and your company. I am happy to recommend TAM skylights for all you day lighting needs.\n\nJOE, KENT\n\nHave you ever had a TAM skylight fail? I’ve been roofing right here in Seattle since 1989. I’ve been roofing right here in Seattle since 1989 and used both Crystalite and TAM (mostly the latter in the last 2 decades) literally hundreds of times per brand. Never once has a TAM skylight failed that I’ve ever seen, whether on one of my installations or others. I find it remarkable that these 2 brands, for all intents and purposes (that I can see) are identical, yet I have confidence in only one of them. TAM is the best, most dependable skylight available in the Northwest. I rely on and recommend TAM Skylights\n\nBLAKE, LYNNWOOD\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nFIND YOUR NEAREST TAM SKYLIGHTS DEALER\n\nVisit a Tam Skylights Dealer near you to find the path to a brighter life.\n\nFIND A DEALER\n\nHOMEOWNERS\nDEALERS\nARCHITECTS\nPRIVACY POLICY\nTERMS OF USE\nSITEMAP\n\n1 (800) SKY-LITE\n\n© Copyright 2018 Tam Industries.

This stress is needed to cause the gasket to undergo plastic deformation to conform to its mating surfaces. This sealing stress is far in excess of any process pressure that the unit may experience. As this sealing stress is always imposed on the gasket and the glass, it causes the gasket to continue deforming and the glass to continue weakening; eventually, excessive deformation of the gasket will cause the gasket to become too thin, resulting in a leak. Simply compressing an already too-thin gasket will often result in damage to the unit. The unique design of PPC's sight glass units eliminates such dangers and guarantees high operational safety and sealing performance under the most extreme temperature and pressure conditions.\n\n\nThe PPC Edge: Our sight glass windows are sealed along the side walls of the glass, not on the surfaces.\nWhen the packing materials that seal our sight glass units are compressed to create the necessary plastic deformation, the sealing compression is applied to the packing material, which surrounds the side wall of the sight window. Without a direct compression path to the glass, the possibility of excessive compression of the sealing material imposing damaging stresses on the glass is greatly reduced. Process pressure, which is applied on the surfaces of the window, is decoupled from the sealing pressure, which is applied on the side walls. This decoupling enables softer, higher-temperature glassy materials such as fused quartz to be used in higher-pressure applications. And if a leak develops, further compression of the sealing material can be achieved with far less danger of damaging the glass window, and without always having to replace the sealing material, which would require taking the unit out of service. Higher pressure and temperature ratings, along with ease of maintaining seals in the real world, are the traits of PPC's sight windows.\t\n\n4540 W.

For over 30 years we have been producing our products for an international customer base.  \n\n\nFounder Scott Sperbeck was captain of a crab vessel in the Bering Sea during a severe Winter storm in 1987. Fighting to see out the iced-up pilothouse windows, an idea came to mind. He used his mechanical and electronics background to design and patent electrically-heated film that would prevent windows from icing up or fogging at sea. The result was the birth of SEACLEAR in 1991. His first-hand experience and understanding of the effects of extreme conditions on marine equipment led to the development of world-class products still made in the USA today.\n\nSEACLEAR is committed to our customers by focusing on a quality product, on-time delivery, and personal service.\n\n©2024 SEACLEAR Industries • All rights reserved\nFor custom glass fabrication and laminating please go to www.fratturaglass.com\nMailing Address:\n2020 Maltby Road • Suite 131\nBothell, WA 98021\n\nPhone: (800) 779-3811\nManufacturing Plant:\n2101 Grant Street\nBellingham, WA 98225\n\nPhone: (360) 659-2700\nv.072224\nWebsite design by Scott Perry Design"

Whether your needs are for a complete series of newly designed Orthodox windows or an individual icon in stained glass we treat each with equal importance.\n\nCreation\nRestoration\nOur Lady of Perpetual Help Home\n\nWe recently created and installed the The Resurrection, a thirteen lancet,  31-by-16-foot stained-glass window in the chapel of Our Lady of Perpetual Help Home in Atlanta, GA. Two additional windows were designed for the Transept windows depicting the Corporal Works of Mercy and installed at a later date. \n\nOriginal Window Designs\n\nYale Repertory Theatre\n\nYale University\n\nRohlf's Studio has restored and replicated over 40,000 stained and leaded glass windows for Yale in New Haven CT.

We have conserved the Ambulatory windows and have preserved the St. Saviour stained glass window, plus new bronze supporting frame system, along with additional repairs to various Chapel windows. \n\nTiffany Stained Glass\n\nLouis Comfort Tiffany and Company (1848-1933), one of America’s foremost masters of decorative art known for its techniques in double-and triple-plating (drapery, iridescent, opalescent and confetti glasses). Rohlf’s Studio has expertise in restoring Tiffany windows as our firm has undertaken the conservation of some of the largest Tiffany windows in the United States. \n\nRestoration of Iconic Tiffany Stained Glass Clock\n\nRohlf’s Studio removed and restored the Tiffany Glass Clock at Grand Central Terminal (GCT) in NYC as part of a 12-year complete renovation and restoration of Grand Central Terminal which began in 1992. Accessible only by a narrow staircase leading to a small ‘clock room,’ each piece was removed from the inside. The glass was brought to Rohlf’s Studio in Mt. Vernon where the process of restoring and replicating the priceless clock took place. Since the pieces had suffered heavy damage since their installation in 1914, Rohlf Studio repaired damaged pieces and replicated missing pieces as part of a complete restoration. After completion, each piece of the largest stained glass design created by Tiffany Studios was carefully reinstalled where it continues to overlook 42nd Street to this day.\n\nSee More\nGallery of Stained Glass Projects\n\nNew Traditional\n\nContemporary\n\nByzantine\n\nRestoration\n\nReplication\n\nHistoric Landmarks\n\nTiffany\n\nInstitutional\n\nJudaic\n\nCarved\n\nMausoleum\n\nCommercial\n\nResidential\n\nProtection\n\nStained Glass Window Restoration\n\nRestoration of priceless stained and leaded glass installations require steady hands and skills mastered over a lifetime by dedicated craftspeople. \n\nA Family Treasure Spanning Four Generations\nRohlf’s\nStained & Leaded Glass\nContact Us\n800-969-4106\nor Email Us\n\nVIEW MORE SAMPLES\n\nCONTACT US: 800-969-4106, Email or Use Our Contact Form\nRohlf's Stained & Leaded Glass Studio, 783 South Third Avenue, Mount Vernon, NY 10550-4946"

Our sandblast carved and etched glass designs for shower doors, tub shower enclosures, dividers and shower glass panels add a dramatic, luxury element to your bathroom, creating obscurity in the glass, whether you need a little or a lot. For most applications, shower glass etchings are designed to cover only portions of the glass, with the etching placed in specific areas to obscure view into the middle of the shower, still allowing the view to your tile, and the ability to see out!  Truly art with a function, one advantage of a frosted glass shower is its ability to hide or obscure water spots between cleaning. Available in any size, shape and configuration, glass thickness for showers will be 3/8” for most applications, but can also be 1/2” thick.\n\nSHOP TUB SHOWER ENCLOSURES\nGlass Partitions\n\nSeparate with Style!\nLooking to divide a space but maintain privacy? A glass partition wall with a frost glass design is the ideal solution! Edges can be straight, polished or feature one of our signature hand chiseled edges. Whether it’s for your home or business, choose from our vast library of etched glass partition designs across every decor, or let us create a brand new design to your specifications. Your company logo can be frosted, carved and even painted with your brand colors, for a truly custom piece that will add elegance and style to your space while creating the privacy you need.\n\nSHOP GLASS PARTITIONS\nDining Table Glass\n\nArt with a Function\nWe turn ordinary plain dining table glass into a highly custom, unique work of art glass. Dining table glass, coffee table glass, consoles, floating bar tops and glass vanities will have an eye catching wow factor like no other with an etched, carved and hand painted glass design by Sans Soucie. Choose one of our signature curved irregular edge designs, or combine a custom edge with a full design that covers more of the glass surface. Designs available across every decor style, carved elements and textures can also feature rich, beautiful color thru airbrush hand painting. Custom color matches can be done to pull in and coordinate with any color in your decor. Available any size, shape and configuration, glass thickness will depend on the size and application, ranging from 1/4″ to 3/4″.\n\nSHOP DINING TABLE GLASS\nGlass Signs\n\nYour Name in Lights!\nPerfect for use in a lobby reception area or anywhere in your office, frosted glass signs create a dramatic, distinctive look for your brand. Fabricated in all shapes and sizes and in a variety of effects and glass colors, your specific brand colors are brought in using custom color matching. Color is added to the carved elements and textures through airbrush hand painting, and adds a high quality appeal to show off your brand. Spot lighting is more than enough to create an eye catching look, but LED edge lighting can also be implemented to illuminate your sign. Stand off posts mounting hardware will be included and is available in a wide variety of finishes to coordinate with other adjacent metal finishes nearby.\n\nSHOP ETCHED GLASS SIGNS\nSafe, Reliable Shipping\n\nFREE SHIPPING to most states, orders are expertly packed in- house by our team and ship fully insured via curbside freight delivery with a tracking number and by delivery appointment.\n\nArrived in perfect condition\n\nI'm a home builder and remodeler and my customer had a very specific look for a door and we found what we were looking for with Sans Soucie Art Glass.

At Sans Soucie, we handcraft stunning decorative vanity mirrors as well as engaging art pieces. Far more custom than a manufactured frame or plain mirror, vanity mirrors can be back lit and feature frosted glass border designs applied around the edges, or to overlay border strips that are UV glued around the perimeter. Depending on what coordinates best with the design, custom edge work such as beveled and hand chiseled irregular edges are also implemented.\n\nSHOP DECORATIVE MIRRORS\nStained Glass and Beveled Glass\n\nA Timeless Tradition\nTruth be told, stained glass is where we got our start! When we first began back in 1976, our original specialty and primary focus was the fine art of stained and leaded glass. Throughout its thousand year history, stained glass is legendary for its beauty and brilliant color. Crafted for use as both windows and glass door inserts, our stained and beveled glass work is some of our most outstanding pieces, all assembled in-house at our Studio in Palm Desert, California, by our skilled artisans.\n\nSHOP STAINED GLASS & BEVELED GLASS\nWe believe in the Art of Making\n\nAt Sans Soucie Art Glass we’ve always believed in the Art of Making. Every grain of sand engraves a permanent work of art into the beautiful etched glass. For us, art is functional. Your home should tell your story. From our hands to your home. Let us help tell your story.\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT US\nCompany\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nReviews\nOur Blog\nExplore\nShop\nOur Products\nOur Process\nTour Our Studio\nLearn\nResources\nFAQs\nMake a Payment\nScreenshare\n© 1999 - 2025 Sans Soucie Art Glass Studios, Inc., All rights reserved.

Поэтому соблюдает ряд требований законодательства, касательно регистрации новых пользователей и приема интерактивных ставок. Далее будет подробно рассмотрено, как проходит идентификация в Леонбетс.\n\nДля чего нужна идентификация в БК Леон\n\nСогласно Федеральному закону РФ №244: без идентификации личности бетторы не имеют права пополнять счет и совершать ставки. Законодательство обязывает букмекеров предварительно идентифицировать новых клиентов.\n\nПроверкой пользователей в России занимаются Первый ЦУПИС и QIWI Банк (в зависимости от конкретной БК). Эти компании также обеспечивают безопасность транзакций.\n\nСпособы верификации\n\nНовым клиентам предлагается 3 варианта:\n\nввести паспортные данные;\nчерез Госуслуги;\nотправить фото паспорта.\n\nПо паспорту\n\nЭтот вариант подходит тем, у кого есть идентифицированный кошелек в системе QIWI. В Личном кабинете необходимо кликнуть по кнопке:\n\nПоявится окно, в котором нужно указать персональные сведения, затем нажать «Далее». Вводить требуется точную информацию и без ошибок. Если указать неактуальные данные, верификация в Леон будет отклонена, а аккаунт заблокирован.\n\nВвод паспортных данных\n\nПолучить верифицированный статус кошелька можно двумя способами:\n\nГде верифицироваться\tПримечание\nВ салонах связи «МегаФон», Contact или «Связной»\tУслуга платная: от 150 до 300 рублей в зависимости от города (в Москве дороже, чем в регионах)\nВ офисах QIWI\tЕсть только в нескольких крупных городах\n\nЧитать также Как вывести деньги с БК Леон\n\nЧерез портал государственных услуг\n\nТребуется верифицированный аккаунт в данной системе. Для проверки личности необходимо в меню выбрать этот вариант, кликнув по нему.\n\nПроизойдет перенаправление на сайт, где пользователь должен авторизоваться, введя телефон (или номер СНИЛС) и пароль. Далее беттору необходимо в списке выбрать БК Леон и следовать инструкциям системы.\n\nВход в аккаунт Госуслуг\n\nПо фотографиям паспорта\n\nЕсли у посетителя нет верифицированных аккаунтов ни в одном из приведенных сервисов, придется воспользоваться третьим способом — загрузить фотографии (или сканы) паспорта.\n\nПосле клика по этой вкладке открывается окно загрузки изображений. Допускается только два формата: JPG или PNG. На них должны быть отчетливо видны все данные (ФИО, дата рождения и так далее). В противном случае сотрудники БК попросят отправить другие снимки. Максимальный размер файлов — 10 Мб.\n\nПосле проверки операторы дополнительно связываются с клиентом, чтобы подтвердить активацию учетной записи.\n\nСроки верификации личности в БК Леон\n\nПри загрузке фото или сканов документа беттору придется подождать 1-2 часа. В течение этого времени сотрудники букмекерской конторы проверят присланные изображения на достоверность. При использовании первых двух вариантов процедура занимает не более 10 минут.\n\nПоделиться: Автор статей и новостей\n\nЕще во времена, когда киберспорт для большинства ограничивался игрой в CS 1.6 и Dota: All Stars в компьютерных клубах, составлял отчеты с турниров\n\nБесплатные трансляции Просто зарегистрируйся в Винлайн и смотри Реклама 18+ Winline.ru Комментарии\n\nКомментариев ещё нет.\n\nОтменить ответ\n\n20.10.2023 в 02:00 20.10.2023 в 18:00 20.10.2023 в 19:00 Полезные статьи о Леон\n\nПриветственный бонус до 25 000 RUB фрибетами\n\nКак получить? Макс. бонус: 25 000 RUB Мин. депозит:\n\nЗарегистрироваться в БК Леон.\nАктивировать бонус при совершении депозита.\nПоложить на баланс от 500 RUB.\nПоставить от 500 RUB на мобильной версии или через приложение БК. Учитывается экспресс или ординар с котировкой от 1.6. В экспрессе коэффициент от 1.6 должен быть хотя бы у одного маркета.\nЗа выполнение перечисленных действий зачисляется фрибет на 1000 RUB. В акции допускается участвовать 25 раз.\nФрибет требуется использовать на ординар с коэффициентом от 1.5 до 2.5. Следует ставить на исход любого футбольного, хоккейного, теннисного или баскетбольного события.\nФрибет доступен 72 часа после получения.\nПри проходе беттору зачисляется чистая прибыль на бонусный баланс.\nДля отыгрыша нужно оформить пять пари по 1000 RUB через приложение или мобильную версию. Коэффициент каждого ординара — от 1.5 до 3.00.

Everyone was very busy. I told the person in the office and she said she would get someone to take care of it right away. After a short time Ed came out and took a look and attached the hose back together under the cowl. He apologized and had it done in a few minutes. The way it was handled is the way things should be, but a lot of companies try to get out of doing the right thing. Thank you very much.\n\nDavid M.\n\nThis company is A+! I’m getting ready to sell my house and a panel in my sliding glass door had lost its seal and was very cloudy. Mt. Hood Glass was recommended to me so I called. They came out the same day to give me an estimate. The estimate was very competitive (better than others I had received) so I ordered on the spot. They called their supplier while I was present to get a delivery date. This was Wednesday and the delivery was scheduled for Friday. They were there promptly on Friday, installed the sliding door glass in short order and I was done! Allen Bayer, the owner, was courteous and professional. I highly recommend!\n\nBarbara J.\n\nHad a windshield replaced on a Peterbilt 387 at Jubitz Truck Stop. I had called ahead and set up appointment in advance. Carl arrived right on time with new windshield and fully equipped van and did an extremely professional installation in about an hour. I highly recommend Mt. Hood Glass.\n\nW.J.\n\nI was trying to finish a Christmas present project last minute yesterday and this place was already closed when I called. He was nice enough not only to stay open while I made my way over there, but to cut a piece of mirror I needed. THEN the next day I realized I had taken the measurements wrong and needed it cut again, they were really nice and even fixed it at no charge.

The quality level of the glass and quartz surfaces after our reconditioning is often better than the original glass and quartz material.\n\nCleaning and Degreasing\nWe use a sophisticated method of ultrasonic glass and quartz parts washing and cleaning that leaves glass dust-free and clean. We use vapor and ultrasonic degreasing and cleaning to remove the toughest glass surface contaminants.\nAt S & S Optical we outperform the competition. Each project starts with glass and quartz of the highest quality from the most reliable suppliers throughout the world. Using our machining technology and expertise we fabricate a precision glass or quartz part that is of the highest quality workmanship, clean and guaranteed to be 100% compliant with the original drawing requirements. In fact, our glass and quartz parts are so good right out of the box, they can be put directly into the just-in-time manufacturing process. Consistent, reliable, cost-effective are words customers use to describe S & S Optical because with the outstanding quality of our finished parts and on-time shipments we help to reduce our customers’ stocking inventory and save them the costs of returning parts.\nContact Us\n\n© 2023 S & S Optical Company, Inc.\n416 Ann Street\nNew Haven, Indiana 46774\nPhone: 260-749-9614"

I have to say that I was totally impressed with the hitch. Not one time did I feel the chucking like I did before with the old hitch. Should have bought this a long time ago. Thanks\n\nRichard C.\n\nWe are much more relaxed in our travels now and consequently can put in a few extra hours of driving towards our destinations without being frind when we get there. Thank you Hensley engineers for designing this GREAT hitch.\n\n\nI recently purchased the Hensley hitch for our travel trailer. We are overwhelmed at how well it works at virtually eliminating the sway we were previously experiencing. We live in Arizona and travel in the Southwest where the winds on these open highways can be quite daunting.
