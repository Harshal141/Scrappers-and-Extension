Kortrax\u00ae acts as a barrier resin (BR) preventing the diffusion and loss of weight that occurs when hydrocarbons migrate into the atmosphere.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBaritainers\u00ae is a revolutionary new way of packaging and transporting hazardous liquid chemicals that have proven difficult to contain, requiring either fluorinated high-density polyethylene (HDPE) containers, EVOH multilayer, or metal packaging. Kortrax\u00ae (Pat. Pending) based Baritainers\u00ae can be used to safely transport volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as household chemicals, industrial & laboratory chemicals, chemical waste, cleaning solvents, adhesives, wood preservatives, automotive fuel additives, additives in the agricultural chemical sector.\n\nAPR, the Association of Plastic Recyclers, is pleased to recognize BP Polymer\u2019s Kortrax\u00ae Barrier Resin (BR) as meeting or exceeding the most strict APR HDPE Critical Guidance criteria HDPE-CG-01 Path 2 (testing for resins and resin blends that incorporate the innovation being tested but have not been converted into package form for both Natural and Colored HDPE stream). This APR recognition is based on the technical recyclability of the barrier resin innovation with HDPE bottles. Learn More\n\nThe Official Award Badge From The Association of Plastic Recyclers\n\nSee Our Products\n\nBaritainers\u00ae Is An Alternative To Metal Containers\n\nPerformance & Testing\n\nBarrier Plastics, Inc. (BPI) is the sole North American manufacturer of Baritainers\u00ae \u2013 a revolutionary new way of packaging and transporting liquid chemicals that have proven difficult to contain and require either fluorinated high-density polyethylene (HDPE) containers or metal packaging. Baritainers\u00ae are a sustainable packaging alternative, and Barrier Plastics is a member of the Greener Package Consortium (www.greenerpackage.com). Because Baritainers\u00ae possess barrier properties, there is no need for further post-manufacturing treatment such as fluorination. Carbon footprint is reduced since additional transportation for treatment of HDPE is eliminated. And the planet is made safer with the reduction in the use of toxic fluorine gas. Since they are lightweight and square, Baritainers\u00ae are an economically attractive alternative to metal packaging. Moreover, Baritainer\u00ae drums, Tight Heads, and IBC\u2019s are UN Certified and Y rated.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhy Use Baritainers\u00ae\nEconomical, Green Packaging, Safety\nPerformance & Testing\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSince they are lightweight and square, Baritainers\u00ae are an economically attractive alternative to metal packaging. Baritainer\u00ae square Tight Heads is approximately 50% less weight versus steel tightheads which results in reduced freight costs and greater cube utilization. Less truckloads not only mean less cost but also reduced emissions. Baritainer\u00ae base material of Baritainer\u00ae is primarily HDPE. Unlike EVOH multi-layer containers, Baritainers\u00ae are recyclable code 2. They do not panel, distort, or lose product. They also prevent chemical permeation and weight loss. Baritainers\u00ae are produced with HDPE and our proprietary barrier resin additive \u2013 Kortrax\u00ae (Pat. Pending). Kortrax\u00ae (Pat. Pending) as a barrier resin (BR) prevents the diffusion and loss of weight that occurs when hydrocarbons migrate into the atmosphere. Baritainers\u00ae have been extensively tested both for efficacy and safety and exhibit better performance characteristics than fluorinated HDPE containers. There is no concern regarding human exposure to PFAS or PFOS.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHow To Use Baritainers\u00ae\n\nBaritainers\u00ae \u2013 a revolutionary new way of packaging and transporting hazardous liquid chemicals that have proven difficult to contain, requiring either fluorinated high-density polyethylene (HDPE) containers, EVOH multi-layer, or metal packaging.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTypical Industries\n\nIndustrial: Chemicals, Solvents, and Petrochemicals.

Kelvin has served the major distilleries in Scotland, Ireland and worldwide continuously since its formation.\n\nIn 1991, Kelvin relocated to Louisville, Kentucky in order to take advantage of Louisville\u2019s proximity to Bourbon Country and to the supply of the finest American oak for barrel production. Kelvin now supplies new and used barrels to leading craft distilleries throughout the world. Today, brothers Kevin McLaughlin and Paul McLaughlin own and operate Kelvin Cooperage.\n\nTo best meet our clients\u2019 needs, we constantly strive to obtain the best oak and utilize the most current machinery while remaining true to time-tested traditional cooperage techniques. Our dedication to maintaining the highest level of quality and service is evident in the care taken at every step of the coopering process. This ensures that every distillery receives a highly crafted, subtly flavored, American oak barrel at an exceptional value.\n\n\n\n\nPARTNERS\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2017 | Kelvin Cooperage"

When washing, ice and water are mixed with flower in a bucket. The mixture is gently stirred. The combination of very cold water and stirring breaks the desirable trichomes away from the plant material. The mixture of ice, water, and flower is then filtered through different micron size bag to \u201ccatch\u201d the extract.\n\nWhy Does Gutenberg's Dank Pressing Co Have The Bet Bubble Bags?\nVarious Gallon Sizes and Micron Sizes\nGET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR PRESSING\nWhat Is Rosin Pressing?\n\nRosin pressing is an extraction process of combining pressure, time, and heat on plant material to create a product that is loaded with flavor and effects (rosin)\n\nWhere Can I Buy Gutenberg's Dank Pressing Co.

Unfortunately, going with this method of manufacturing can lead to lower quality products and many mistakes in production. This does not provide the customer with high value.\n\nLearn More\nAbout Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Return Policy\n    \n\nDesigned by Elegant Themes | Powered by WordPress\n\n My Rewards\n\nGutenberg's Dank Pressing Co.\u2122 FREE 1-4 DAY SHIPPING FOR ORDERS $50 OR OVER (After any discount codes)\n\nGot it!\nX"

The latter is especially useful if those recruited are new to the industry or 'need to know' for specific project work.\n\nIt can be extremely beneficial to a project if those team members are given an opportunity to understand the technology of the packaging to be used.\n\nCOST SAVING\n\nIn general MCpack will expect to save 10% off any current annual packaging spend - either direct or indirect.\n\nThis might be done by a combination of packaging or packaging line modifications.\n\nRE SOURCING\n\nWith the advent of the Global Market has come the possibility to buy quality packaging from around the world.\n\nMike has established good contacts in the EU , Middle and Far East for supply of packaging.\n\nThere are opportunities to reduce direct costs by adopting a global sourcing strategy.\n\nMCpack is able to ensure that any benefits are realised by putting in place suitable technical controls.\n\nPACKING LINE / PACKAGING COMPATIBILITY\n\nAll packaging lines need to be process capable in order to deliver expected profits.\n\nSome significant projects have been undertaken to improve efficiencies at the material/ machine interface.\n\nHOW WE HELP\nWE LISTEN TO THE CLIENT\n\nBriefings for projects can come from many areas within a business and MCpack is aware of the importance of listening to the client brief and ensuring that the key requirements are understood.\n\nWE MEET THE BRIEF\n\nBy taking care to listen to the brief the outcomes from any work that is undertaken will provide relevant solutions.\n\nWE ARE ON TIME AND ON BUDGET\n\nMCpack will provide firm costs for the early stages of the project and approximate costs for the latter stages.\n\nGated stages within a project will be set up to give visibility to the overall objective.

We all thrive within this culture of competition and change.\n\nThe UK retail model tries not only to be Environmentally honest but also to satisfy the commercial realities of the consumer and the marketplace.\n\nAt the moment the Retailers are being questioned about their power over the marketplace.\n\nJust for a moment consider the situation without the InterRetailer competition.\n\nThere would be fragmentation in direction and purpose to a point where the status quo would thrive.\n\nThe UK packaging development sector would be moribund overnight.\n\nIssues might exist with planning, farmers cash returns etc but for the packaging development industry the Big 5 are 'good for business'."

Approximately six kilos of pi\u00f1a produces one kilo of agave syrup.\n\n100% BLUE AGAVE\n\n\nOrgave brand organic 100% blue agave syrup (nectar) is made from blue agave plants grown on our own farms in Jalisco, Mexico where our family has been growing blue agave for three generations.\n\nOnce the syrup is extracted, it is filtered into either Premium (light color) or Raw (dark color). \u00a0Orgave Raw agave syrup is filtered less, giving it a fuller flavor then our Premium nectar, however, they both are equally sweet and in general, agave syrup is 1.5 times sweeter then sugar.\n\nBoth types are used as sweeteners for drinks or baking, on cereals, in desserts, candies, smoothies, teas, coffees and can be substituted for sugar products, honey and maple syrup.\n\n\u00a0\n\nVIEW OUR PRODUCTS >>>\n\nAgave syrup's flavor is mild, slightly caramel-like, with a delicate floral aroma, with the raw variety having a stronger flavor. \u00a0\n\nAdditionally, shelf life for Orgave is three years making it an ideal ingredient as a sweetener. \u00a0Our product line includes 12 ounce and 24 ounce bottles, one gallon jugs and 55 gallon drums. Please contact us for further information and wholesale pricing.\n\nNo chemicals of any kind are used to produce Orgave pure blue agave syrup and Orgave is certified organic. Orgave is distributed exclusively by Natural Substitute International, Inc.\n\n\u00a0\n\nORGANICALLY GROWN\n\nNATURAL SUBSTITUTE INTERNATIONAL\nOUR COMMITMENT\n\nNatural Substitute International and our Orgave brand, are the fruits of our 24 years of growing organic Blue Agave.  We are second generation family farmers growing and providing organic Blue Agave and organic Blue Agave syrup in Jalisco, Mexico.\n\nNatural Substitute International is committed to providing the highest quality organic Blue Agave products here in the United States and internationally.

I started out working on Saturdays changing molds and working some \u00a0evenings while in school at my friends fathers Blow Molding & Injection Molding plant in New England. This is where the plastic bug bit me.\n\n\nSince that time I have had the most exciting career in the Plastics & Packaging Industries.

After bitumen was no longer permitted, water-resistant tubes and cores were made from thickly coated materials for certain industrial customers. Signode's current Van Antwerpen Cartonnage product line includes a number of different products using one production method, which is a continuous process of sealing strips of paper or cardboard together. The Van Antwerpen Cartonnage\u00a0product range consists of various types of round cartons and corner profiles. These are delivered on order to industrial or private customers.\n\nCost Efficient\n\nUsing products to provide faster project progress as well as reducing concrete supply costs\n\nEasy Application\n\nEasy to apply and dismantle according to requirements\n\nCustomisable\u00a0\n\nAvailable to meet your needs, Signode is \u00a0capable of producing deviating diameters\n\n\n\n\nDurable\n\nProducts are lightweight and the use of products without the need of a crane. Products are also long lasting.\n\n\n\n\nFlexibility and Application\n\nIn addition to the standard diameters, it is possible to produce deviating diameters. These diameters can vary from 38 mm to 1200 mm. The wall thickness of the cores can vary from 1 mm for the smaller diameters to 6 mm for the larger diameters. The application of Signode's Van Antwerpen Cartonnage products such as Monotub DD, are brilliant for the construction industry following rigorous research and development as well as multiple specifications to meet all needs.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nCores and Stretch Film\n\nCores have been widely used for many years as a wrapping core for stretch wrapping film. Film winding companies opt for the core because it allows a higher winding speed on their machines. Due to the special sealing process, Signode's\u00a0Van Antwerpen Cartonnage cores have a higher strength than regular glued cores. The core is proven within tape converters due to sealing procedure facilitating less dust during the cutting process.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nProducts\nCardboard Cores\n\nHigh technology grinding and polishing lines offer very sensitive \u2018\u2019smooth surface cardboard cores\u2019\u2019 to plastic film industry.\n\nSee more\nMonotub DD\n\nFormwork for circular columns in construction.\n\nSee more\n\nSignode Industrial Group LLC\nHidden River Corporate Center Two\n14025 Riveredge Drive\nSuite 500\nTampa, Florida 33637\n\n1-800-323-2464\n\nTransit Packaging Division of Crown Holdings, Inc\n(Opens in a new window)\n\nIndustries\nProducts\nCustomer Experience Center\nSolutions\nBrands\nSuppliers\nGovernance\nNews\nEvents\nAbout Us\nApplication Stories\nCareers\n(Opens in a new window)\nContact Us\nLocations\nPatents\n\nFollow us\n\n(Opens in a new window)\n(Opens in a new window)\nCookies Policy\nPrivacy\nHealth Care Transparency\nAccessibility\nTerms & Conditions of Website Use\nCookie Settings\n\n\u00a9 2025 Signode Industrial Group LLC\n\nWe use third-party cookies to provide content like videos, to improve the performance, or analyze traffic to our site, and/or to personalize your experience of our site.

This is true for commodities during transport, handling, and storage due to them being prone to moisture, oxidation, or insect infestation.\n\nAn Organic Solution!\n\nBring in the VacQPack system and packaging materials to prevent food loss and decrease food waste. How? With MAP technology!\n\nA SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION\nWhat is MAP Technology?\n\nModified atmosphere packaging (MAP) has been applied in the food industry for over 90 years. The technology is used to literally modify the internal atmosphere in packaging by reducing oxygen and replacing it with carbon dioxide (CO2) or nitrogen (N2). This slows down the oxidation process and eliminates insects in all life stages. MAP is a great way of extending shelf-life and preserving quality!\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\n\u00a92025.

Our products have all the required certificates and are available as sheets, sachets, gussets, pouches, etc. Please check our profile here \u00a0https://heyzine.com/flip-book/2bac1a080e.html\u00a0\u00a0and our product here https://heyzine.com/flip-book/f1c3aa1de8.html\nBio-Stimulant For Agricultural Purpose\nEdible\nConvenient\nSafe For Animals, Aquatic Life and Microbial Diversity\nZero Allergen Risk\nEmpower Coastal Communities\nHalal\nCreate job in factory\nCruelty-Free\nCompostable\nNon-Toxic\nRenewable Material\nWE SUPPORT 14 PILLARS OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS\u200b\nSocial\nEnvironmental\nEconomy\nBiopac is Driven by The Urge to Solve Plastic Problems\n\n11 MMT of plastic leaks into the ocean, ensnaring animals or confusing them for food. Furthermore, this plastic finds its way into our food chain.\n\nBreaking The Plastic Wave reported that 11 MMT of plastic leaked into the ocean in 2016. 80% of it comes in flexible and multilayer packaging. 11% of the leakage has been transformed into microplastic. If we do not take action soon, this condition will worsen; in fact, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish.\n\nWhat are flexible and multilayered packaging?\n\nSome examples of flexible packaging are plastic wrap, bubble wrap, shrink wrap, shopping bags, rice wraps, burger wraps, aluminum foil, and metalized packaging.\n\nMultilayer packaging is packaging that consists of more than 1 layer; it can be flexible or semirigid. Examples of multilayer packaging include rice wraps, burger wraps, paper cups, and metalized sachets.\n\nPlastic waste is closely related with health problems.\n\nA team of researchers from the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB) examined three distinct kinds of tea bags and discovered that each one released microplastics and nanoplastics. The amounts of microplastics and nanoplastics particles released per milliliter of water by nylon-6, cellulose, and polypropylene tea bags were 8.18 million, 135 million, and 1.2 billion, respectively. Another research group from Cornell University stresses the serious consequences of microplastics and nanoplasticsfor possible chronic disorders.\n\nInhaling the volatile substances released into the air by burning plastic can cause cancer. According to studies, plasticizers, elastomers, flame retardants, and ultraviolet (UV) absorbers are all volatile additives. Therefore, burning plastic releases toxic chemicals into the air. These organisms could potentially develop cancer if they inhale these toxic chemicals.\n\nCoastal communities have the right to have good wellbeing.\n\nHow can seaweed farmers have well-being if their average net income in the South Kuta District ranges from IDR 752.426 to IDR 1.983.268 per household?\u00a0 Because of this, individuals are at risk of being victims of human trafficking and unable to meet their most fundamental requirements.\n\nWe provide tester package to give you the experience and journey of using our products & explore their application for your products with the vision to\u00a0ennoble our earth by stop littering.\n\nOur business is beyond a solution for plastic waste problem.

At the time there were very few companies that were producing Hemp isolates in a format that would integrate or infuse into liquids, especially water. In fact, most isolates looked like tar and tasted terrible. Today there is a wide array of hemp products ranging from isolates to broad and full spectrum extracts that work wonderfully. As the science of these ingredients has advanced, so have we, and are proud of reaching major milestones as a leading producer and manufacturer of hemp infused products. We were one of the first to get products through an FDA registration, and another first with getting USDA Organic Certifications for products produced at our facilities. Whether you are looking for cost sensitive production, or have a high-end Organic game changer, the CBD Copackers are here to help you make an impact in today\u2019s ever expanding hemp-based products market.\n\nUNIQUE INFUSION CAPABILITIES\nLiquid Based Food & Beverage Products\nOur specialty is to infuse CBD into fluid based food & beverage products, and limited only by your imagination.\n\u00a0 6 KEY POINTS\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &\nOur Special Technology\n\t\nLegal & Compliance\n\nThe core of our business revolves around legal & compliance. Between HEMP CBD State Regulation, and food processing compliance to FDA standards, we are always focused on maintaining compliance, a top priority.\n\n\t\nInfusion Technologies\n\nOur proprietary micro-clustered technology increases bioavailability, and our equipment allows us the opportunity to infuse nearly any liquid-based product with CBD without any separation, taste, discoloration, or clarity issues.\n\n\t\nPackaging Options\n\nOur packaging options are as diverse as the products we produce. With multiple filling systems available, we can pack almost any bottle, jar or sachet, enabling our customers to make an impact on the shelf.\n\n\t\nHot & Cold Production\n\nWhat really sets us apart is our sophistication that revolves around both hot and cold fill manufacturing capabilities. Our ability to bring new products to market that are shelf-life stable and safe for consumption is the best in the industry.\n\n\t\nQuality Control & Lab Testing\n\nEvery product in our facility is tested for quality, efficacy, and regulatory compliance with the strictest of standards. Between shelf life, infusion dosing levels, and more, we make sure everything we produce is top quality.\n\n\t\nExpert Advice\n\nWe assist our client\u2019s business by providing advice on a broad range of subjects. We truly have a vested interest in our clients since the better your product does, the more we get to make.

We pride ourselves on personalized service.\u00a0\n\nGlass \u2014 The Natural Alternative\n\nGlass is made \u00a0from all-natural materials. It is the preferred packaging among customers who value it for maintaining the purity of the foods and beverages they consume.\n\nISO Standards of Excellence\n\nGallo Glass is committed to providing a safe and healthful workplace that manufactures quality products, according to food safety standards, in an environmentally responsible and energy efficient manner. We are ISO 14001 and 22000 certified.\u00a0\n\nOver\n\nYears of Innovation\n0\n1950s\nWhen it All Began\n\nWhen Ernest and Julio Gallo founded the Gallo Glass Company in 1958, they were launching a new era in bottle making. They had a vision for state-of-the-art glass manufacturing that would meet the needs of consumers while minimizing the impact on the environment.\n\n1970s\nBreaking Through the Turbulence\n\nWhen many glassmaking factories were shutting their doors because of the energy crisis, Gallo glass was picking up steam. With the addition of two new furnaces, they we able to manufacture more bottles with five operating furnaces.\n\n1980s\nThinking Smarter, Not Harder\n\nWith the rising environmental concerns over glass manufacturing, Gallo made its process more efficient and less wasteful. They invested in triple gob coolers and designed smaller bottles. They also switched from mechanical to computerized timing control.\n\n1990s\nTaking Oxy-Fuel Firing Full Steam\n\nMany companies were researching effective methods for reducing NOx emissions, but Gallo Glass was a pioneer at making it possible on a larger scale by building their first cryogenic oxygen facility armed with electrostatic precipitator emissions control equipment.\n\n2000s\nA Clear Path for a New Era\n\nThe installation of modern equipment and processes gave a boost to the firing and manufacturing speed. With that Gallo was able to increase the overall quality, ISO and automation for bulk production while decreasing bottle weight.\n\n2010s\nSeeing a Sustainable Future\n\nThroughout the decades, glassmaking has revolutionized for the sake of the environment and Gallo Glass is proud of what they\u2019ve contributed. They continue their commitment to sustainability by maintaining state-of-the-art furnaces, modern manufacturing processes and control practices.\n\nPrevious\n1970s\n1980s\n1990s\n2000s\n2010s\n1950s\n1970s\n1980s\n1990s\n2000s\n2010s\n1950s\n1970s\n1980s\n1990s\n2000s\n2010s\nNext\nWe are dedicated to upholding the highest environmental standards and leading the global glass industry with energy-efficient furnaces.\nGallo Glass was the first industrial application of oxy fuel technology in container glass, reducing NOx emissions by 80% or the equivalent to taking over 97,000 cars off the road.\nWe are on the forefront of innovation across the industry with advancements in lighter weight bottles, Eco Flint, clear glass flint reclamation, and so much more.\nTel: 209.341.4527 (GLAS)\n\n\u00a9 2024 Gallo Glass Company ALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nISO 14001\n\nISO 22000\n\nJOIN OUR TALENT NETWORK\nUse Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\nSuppliers\n\nAn Equal Opportunity Employer \u2013 All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or status as a protected veteran."

Cryoport Systems provided me with a lot of helpful information and great advice. It's rare and refreshing to receive such great service.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot only did my cells arrive safely, Cryoport Systems\u2019 service was professional and efficient. I highly recommend Cryoport Systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorking with Cryoport Systems was a truly remarkable difference compared to my experience with other companies. With the previous shipping company I was working with, it took almost three months to establish a \u2018deep frozen account\u2019 and required numerous hoop-jumping shenanigans only to ultimately be informed that the company could not arrange a shipment to or from Israel, which they were informed from the start was our desired shipping source.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur organization is more than impressed by our experience with Cryoport Systems. We feel confident our material is being well-managed throughout each step in the supply chain. Cryoport Systems provides extraordinary customer service. Continuously, they not only meet but exceed our expectations. Late yesterday afternoon, Cryoport Systems worked tirelessly to coordinate a shipment to Japan, and today seemed to effortlessly manage a late-day return. It is a pleasure working with Cryoport Systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to thank everyone at Cryoport Systems who was involved in the rapid recovery of the missing Cryoport Systems shipper containing a patient\u2019s tumor tissue. By promptly locating the shipper and recharging it while in transit, the patient was able to receive the vaccine manufactured from this tissue on time. We are so very appreciative of Cryoport Systems\u2019 customer service. Without the services that Cryoport Systems provides, our clinical trials would not be available to patients.\"\n\nLearn more\nAbout Us\nOur People\nManagement\nQuality\nBrowse solutions\nBioServices\nConsulting Services\nShipping Systems\nIntegriCell\u2122 Cryopreservation\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nNever miss another update!

By implementing SparkMES, Belden transitioned to a real-time data-driven operation, boosting OEE by 18% and driving $500,000 in annual performance gains. This transformation not only streamlined workflows but also fostered a cultural shift toward digital innovation, paving the way for smart manufacturing across their global operations.\n\nVIEW THE CASE STUDY\nI was surprised at the amount of meaningful work that I was given to do. I worked on multiple projects for clients that were deployed for use.\nFlexware Innovation helped educate us on the benefits of MES. We chose to implement a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) MES product with a global professional services firm. Our experience with the larger firm, and the resulting solution we have today falls short of meeting our needs. We are now partnering with Flexware for future phases of our MES design and rollouts. I am confident that we would have been much further ahead if we would have partnered with Flexware 3 years ago.\u201d\nDiscrete Manufacturer\nWorking for Flexware Innovation as a Trailblazer intern is a unique and rewarding experience. Not only did Flexware take the time to introduce me to new concepts I hadn\u2019t pursued before, such as creating a service in C# based around RFID technology, but they also care enough about their employees to help develop them personally and professionally. The professional development days were great, whether it was getting exposure to various facilities and industries Flexware works with, or sitting down with several admin level employees receiving advice from them on resumes, interviewing, or our personal LinkedIn profiles.\nI enjoyed working at one of Flexware\u2019s large food and beverage manufacturing customers and working with their automation team. Going into the summer, I knew very little about high power distribution systems. However, I can now say I know the factory\u2019s power distribution better than most of their employees. I was also able to further develop my PLC programming skills in their automation lab. It has been an amazing experience being able to work with Flexware and the client to apply what I have learned in class while also working on important projects.\nI really enjoyed the Trailblazer Program because it gave me the opportunity to do so much more than a typical internship. I worked on projects that mattered and developed professionally through plant tours and other fun activities such as the balloon launch.\nFrom automation to business intelligence, Flexware gave me the opportunity to explore work in many different areas. It was a summer of trying new things and learning what I want and don\u2019t want to do. Flexware is a unique internship where you not only get work experience but also build relationships, and develop professionally. Flexware spends time to make you a better employee by teaching you essential skills such as writing a resume, conducting yourself in an interview, and making good business decisions. It is a company that cares about their people. From day one I felt like part of the team and that I was working on something helpful to the company.\nThe Trailblazer Internship Program exposed me to so many facets of both business and engineering in industry. Flexware focuses on providing project work in areas of interest to each intern. The professional development days offer a variety of learning experiences and were one of my favorite components of the internship. The summer was filled with wonderful interactions with both FlexDogs and the other interns.\nMy Trailblazer experience was extremely rewarding. Through working at a local sheet metal manufacturer and professional development days at Flexware with the other interns, I have grown professionally, as well gained beneficial experience in the manufacturing side of engineering.\nI really enjoyed my Trailblazer internship for several reasons. Firstly, I gained my skills working with Microsoft Calendar API, OAuth 2.0 Authentication mechanism, \u2018Ignition\u2019 SCADA system and \u2018IQ FMEA\u2019 framework for Failure \u2013 Mode effect analysis. Secondly, I developed my professional network and made money. Also, I made good friends. And, finally, Professional Development Days made Trailblazer Internship stand out!\nPeople were always ready and willing to help me whenever I had a question or messed something up. Additionally, I enjoyed each of the Professional Development Days, as they provided us a way to interact with the other Trailblazers and allowed us to see the environment in which others were working. Other than the company tours, I also found the life and career skills days to be valuable, and they allowed us to grow in more than just technical ways. I especially liked the resume reviews, as this helped me to improve my resume and learn more about what recruiters are looking for.\nThe type of person I would recommend to apply for the internship is someone who really appreciates Flexware\u2019s core values. A person who does not require much assistance or guidance to complete a given task would be successful in the Trailblazer Internship program.\nOur company has had a long history with Flexware. Flexware delivered many successful HMI/SCADA solutions in our facility in the late 1990\u2019s. Most recently, Flexware is delivering a full MES solution to our facility and is instrumental in the start-up of 2 brand new manufacturing lines. Their technical expertise, vision, and work ethic are second to none.\u201d\nDiscrete Manufacturer\nWe partnered with Flexware Innovation because of their expertise in the field of MES, their relationship and involvement with MESA, and their familiarity with ISA standards in this area. Flexware helped us articulate our requirements by educating our teams on what MES is, and how it can benefit our business. We believe it has been a great benefit to have a trusted advisor looking out for our best interest throughout this process. Our selection process has been very enlightening and educational due to help we received from Flexware's professionals.\"\nLife Science Manufacturer\n\"Working with Flexware for almost 4 years, I have seen myself grow as a professional in more than one way. Flexware embraces flexibility, not just in terms of location (remote or hybrid model), but also in the kind of work that you would like to do. I could nurture my career development by finding a suitable role that suits my personality, interests, and abilities. Flexware provides you with ample opportunities to widen your horizons and experiment with different aspects of technology. At Flexware Innovation, we believe in the kind of work we are doing for our customers, and how we can impact their businesses while doing so your contributions are recognized in the company frequently, and it does not have to wait for the bi-annual reviews, which gives a great sense of positivity and purpose to the work you are doing. The high-energy atmosphere, the transparent culture, and the constant leadership support without ever feeling that you are being micromanaged helped me grow as a true professional.\"\nFlexware Innovation\n\"In addition to our culture, I appreciate the wealth of opportunities we have to serve our company, customers, and each other, which leads to deep, mutually beneficial relationships. I love our core values, in particular, Say it Like it Is (with humility and respect), which allow us to dial in solutions quickly and efficiently while fostering transparency.\"\nFlexware Innovation\n\"I enjoy working at Flexware because of a few things. I appreciate that there is trustworthiness amongst our team. I am treated well and with respect. I enjoy the amount of transparency our leaders provide to the Flexdogs, and the importance of health in the company, both physically and financially. I also like the flexibility of being able to work from home, so I watch my son. Lastly, I simply enjoy the work I do and making a difference for a greater purpose. My favorite core value is \"never stop learning.\" I can practice this not only on a daily basis in my personal life but at work as well. I am constantly challenged with new ideas and experiences that push me to learn more. My knowledge deepens with each project, and I enjoy taking on the unknowns.\"\nFlexware Innovation\n\"I wanted to thank you all for the training last week. It was one of the best training classes I have attended in the past 15 years. The way the information was delivered, the help people were able to receive, and no question went unanswered it was all great, and I look forward to more classes if and when they become available. I definitely recommend this class for anyone wanting to get into Ignition.\"\nSmithfield Foods\n\"Having tailored consulting where we are deficient is second to none.\u00a0 In a very short amount of time, the ES Team closed gaps in my knowledge which aided me in making the changes needed with our cloud infrastructure.\"\nIndustry - Supply Chain\n\"We needed a PowerApps form to help with internal requests for product samples across multiple global sites.

Before this internship I was unfamiliar with SQL Server and Oracle Databases. In order to help my team with testing I had to be able to manipulate and navigate in these databases. I faced this problem by learning new skills and features of the software as I progressed in the project. By the end of the project, I felt I gained the necessary skills to do similar projects in the future.\nThe helpfulness of the Flexdogs, as well as the inviting family atmosphere in the office surprised me most during my time at Flexware. I enjoyed the interactions with my team and the other interns on a daily basis. I not only gained technical experience, but professional work habits.\nI was surprised at how high the status of the Trailblazers was to the year-round employees.

I am confident that we would have been much further ahead if we would have partnered with Flexware 3 years ago.\u201d\nDiscrete Manufacturer\nWorking for Flexware Innovation as a Trailblazer intern is a unique and rewarding experience. Not only did Flexware take the time to introduce me to new concepts I hadn\u2019t pursued before, such as creating a service in C# based around RFID technology, but they also care enough about their employees to help develop them personally and professionally. The professional development days were great, whether it was getting exposure to various facilities and industries Flexware works with, or sitting down with several admin level employees receiving advice from them on resumes, interviewing, or our personal LinkedIn profiles.\nI enjoyed working at one of Flexware\u2019s large food and beverage manufacturing customers and working with their automation team. Going into the summer, I knew very little about high power distribution systems. However, I can now say I know the factory\u2019s power distribution better than most of their employees. I was also able to further develop my PLC programming skills in their automation lab. It has been an amazing experience being able to work with Flexware and the client to apply what I have learned in class while also working on important projects.\nI really enjoyed the Trailblazer Program because it gave me the opportunity to do so much more than a typical internship. I worked on projects that mattered and developed professionally through plant tours and other fun activities such as the balloon launch.\nFrom automation to business intelligence, Flexware gave me the opportunity to explore work in many different areas. It was a summer of trying new things and learning what I want and don\u2019t want to do. Flexware is a unique internship where you not only get work experience but also build relationships, and develop professionally. Flexware spends time to make you a better employee by teaching you essential skills such as writing a resume, conducting yourself in an interview, and making good business decisions. It is a company that cares about their people. From day one I felt like part of the team and that I was working on something helpful to the company.\nThe Trailblazer Internship Program exposed me to so many facets of both business and engineering in industry. Flexware focuses on providing project work in areas of interest to each intern. The professional development days offer a variety of learning experiences and were one of my favorite components of the internship. The summer was filled with wonderful interactions with both FlexDogs and the other interns.\nMy Trailblazer experience was extremely rewarding. Through working at a local sheet metal manufacturer and professional development days at Flexware with the other interns, I have grown professionally, as well gained beneficial experience in the manufacturing side of engineering.\nI really enjoyed my Trailblazer internship for several reasons. Firstly, I gained my skills working with Microsoft Calendar API, OAuth 2.0 Authentication mechanism, \u2018Ignition\u2019 SCADA system and \u2018IQ FMEA\u2019 framework for Failure \u2013 Mode effect analysis. Secondly, I developed my professional network and made money. Also, I made good friends. And, finally, Professional Development Days made Trailblazer Internship stand out!\nPeople were always ready and willing to help me whenever I had a question or messed something up. Additionally, I enjoyed each of the Professional Development Days, as they provided us a way to interact with the other Trailblazers and allowed us to see the environment in which others were working. Other than the company tours, I also found the life and career skills days to be valuable, and they allowed us to grow in more than just technical ways. I especially liked the resume reviews, as this helped me to improve my resume and learn more about what recruiters are looking for.\nThe type of person I would recommend to apply for the internship is someone who really appreciates Flexware\u2019s core values. A person who does not require much assistance or guidance to complete a given task would be successful in the Trailblazer Internship program.\nOur company has had a long history with Flexware.

Flexware embraces flexibility, not just in terms of location (remote or hybrid model), but also in the kind of work that you would like to do. I could nurture my career development by finding a suitable role that suits my personality, interests, and abilities. Flexware provides you with ample opportunities to widen your horizons and experiment with different aspects of technology. At Flexware Innovation, we believe in the kind of work we are doing for our customers, and how we can impact their businesses while doing so your contributions are recognized in the company frequently, and it does not have to wait for the bi-annual reviews, which gives a great sense of positivity and purpose to the work you are doing. The high-energy atmosphere, the transparent culture, and the constant leadership support without ever feeling that you are being micromanaged helped me grow as a true professional.\"\nFlexware Innovation\n\"In addition to our culture, I appreciate the wealth of opportunities we have to serve our company, customers, and each other, which leads to deep, mutually beneficial relationships. I love our core values, in particular, Say it Like it Is (with humility and respect), which allow us to dial in solutions quickly and efficiently while fostering transparency.\"\nFlexware Innovation\n\"I enjoy working at Flexware because of a few things. I appreciate that there is trustworthiness amongst our team. I am treated well and with respect. I enjoy the amount of transparency our leaders provide to the Flexdogs, and the importance of health in the company, both physically and financially. I also like the flexibility of being able to work from home, so I watch my son. Lastly, I simply enjoy the work I do and making a difference for a greater purpose. My favorite core value is \"never stop learning.\" I can practice this not only on a daily basis in my personal life but at work as well. I am constantly challenged with new ideas and experiences that push me to learn more. My knowledge deepens with each project, and I enjoy taking on the unknowns.\"\nFlexware Innovation\n\"I wanted to thank you all for the training last week.

The first machines were manufactured in Mr. Hayssen's garage with the help of just one mechanic.\n\nHayssen was a privately-held and family-owned company from 1910 until 1966, when it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bemis Company, a principal manufacturer of packaging materials and specialty coated and graphics products headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In May, 1997 Hayssen was acquired by Barry-Wehmiller and is now a BW Flexible Systems brand.\n\nHayssen Flexible Packaging: The Full History\nCONTACT OUR SALES TEAM\nRelated Markets\nFood Filling Equipment & Solutions\nFood Service Packaging Equipment\nIndustrial & Automotive Packaging Equipment\nMedical Packaging Equipment\nPet Food & Animal Feed Packaging Equipment\n\n\nBrowse\u00a0\nHAYSSEN ISB (INTELLIGENT SANITARY BAGGER)\nRequest a Quote\nLearn More\nCM VERUS\nRequest a Quote\nLearn More\nIM VERUS\nRequest a Quote\nLearn More\nHAYSSEN MINI\nRequest a Quote\nLearn More\nULTIMA SVJ SANITARY VFFS\nRequest a Quote\nLearn More\nULTIMA SVJ VFFS\nRequest a Quote\nLearn More\nULTIMA VFFS\nRequest a Quote\nLearn More\nLOGIC INTEGRATED PACKAGING SYSTEMS\nRequest a Quote\nLearn More\nLOGIC C\nRequest a Quote\nLearn More\nLOGIC F\nRequest a Quote\nLearn More\nLOGIC S\nRequest a Quote\nLearn More\nHAYSSEN R300 FLOW WRAPPER\nRequest a Quote\nLearn More\nHAYSSEN RT2000 HFFS\nRequest a Quote\nLearn More\nROSE FORGROVE INTEGRA (BOTTOM REEL)\nRequest a Quote\nLearn More\nROSE FORGROVE INTEGRA (TOP REEL)\nRequest a Quote\nLearn More\nROSE FORGROVE MINERVA\nRequest a Quote\nLearn More\nSCHIB\u00ae CO50 HORIZONTAL FLOW WRAPPER\nRequest a Quote\nLearn More\nSCHIB CO50 BB\nRequest a Quote\nLearn More\nSCHIB CO50 TG\nRequest a Quote\nLearn More\nSCHIB CO50 BBTG\nRequest a Quote\nLearn More\nSCHIB CO90\nRequest a Quote\nLearn More\nSCHIB CO90E\nRequest a Quote\nLearn More\nSCHIB CO100 BISCUITS ON EDGE PACKAGING\nRequest a Quote\nLearn More\nSCHIB\u00ae CO 130-140INT\nRequest a Quote\nLearn More\n40+ Locations Worldwide\n\nBW Flexible Systems is part of BW Packaging.

Applications include standard exhaust gas instruments used as diagnostic tools for mechanics to test tailpipe emissions. Specialized food packaging gas measurement in portable battery operated instruments provide food processors that are packaging using modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) processes a means to confirm that their packaging will deliver the extended shelf life which food manufacturers expect.\n\nModified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) Gas Analyzers\n\nMAP gas analyzers are used by food processors to confirm that their finished product package is fully sealed from air intrusion and incorporates the proper gas mixture to meet desired shelf life and product appearance standards. By reducing the oxygen levels in the final package the product shelf life can be extended. With the addition of CO2, anaerobic bacteria growth can be minimized. For case ready meat packing, the addition of very low levels of CO gas maintains the expected appearance of meat even in a low oxygen environment. Many fresh cut produce foods are packaged in modified atmosphere packaging including ready to eat salad bags, spinach, fresh cut apple slices, fresh snack packs and coffee.\n\nExhaust Gas Analyzers\n\nEGA analyzers are used by fork lift service technicians, motorcycle enthusiasts, automotive repair facilities and indoor vehicle operators across North America to performance tune engines and/or diagnose and confirm proper exhaust emission levels. Our hand held units include a 2-gas, 4-gas and 5-gas analyzer. The 2-gas unit measures CO and HC. The 4-gas unit measures CO, CO2, O2 and HC. The 5-gas unit measures CO, CO2, O2, HC and NOx.\n\nCustomers We Serve\n\nBridge Analyzers welcomes specific inquiries on your unique gas analysis application.

Brandt & Sons apart.\n\nWe\u2019ve embraced the latest advances in fruit production and packaging. In fact, we\u2019ve innovated a few of them ourselves. Our quality assurance program is second to none.\n\nBut we\u2019ve also held fast to the belief that there is no substitute for experience and judgment. We know the only way to assure consistently top-quality fruit is by hands-on attention to detail, day in and day out. From cultivation and harvest to packing, storage and shipping, the Brandt family intensively manages every aspect of production with one goal in mind: making sure our fruit arrives at your store fresh and flavorful \u2013 nature\u2019s masterpiece at its best.\n\nAPPLE VARIETIES\nRemBrandt Fruit\nCHERRY VARIETIES\nRemBrandt Fruit\nPEACH VARIETIES\nRemBrandt Fruit\nNECTARINE VARIETIES\nRemBrandt Fruit\nPEAR VARIETIES\nRemBrandt Fruit\nAPRICOT VARIETIES\nRemBrandt Fruit\nITALIAN PRUNES\nRemBrandt Fruit\nOUR STANDARDS\n\nWE STRIVE FOR EXCELLENCE\n\nE.W. Brandt & Son\u2019s has long been at the forefront of quality standards and food safety. We were the first fruit company in the United States to be certified SQF 2000 Level 3 and we\u2019ve built a global reputation for exceptional high-quality fruit from this rigorous international standard.\n\nOur commitment to quality starts in the orchard. RemBrandt\u00ae Fruit comes from two sources: The orchards we own, also known as TLC Orchards and from a select group of growers who meet our quality/safety criteia. We stay consistent\u00a0in managing the cultivation and harvesting process by sometimes picking from the same tree as many as 3 times to reach that optimum sweetness & color.\n\nThat same commitment overflows into our state of the art quality control system. With this system that is in place we can provide detailed data and control across every aspect of our operation. Also allowing us to meticulously manage and track every single box of fruit that we deliver because of it\u2019s specific/unique design for the fruit industry. Behind these systems and processes, we at RemBrandt\u00ae Fruit foster a culture of excellence. From that culture we set ourselves apart by placing our people in the right areas and personally oversee ever detail.\n\nABOUT US\n\nE.W. BRANDT & SONS, INC. HISTORY\n\nGrowing\u00a0fruit\u00a0is in the Brandt family blood. We\u2019ve been farming in the Yakima Valley since 1947 when Everette and Ada Brandt purchased 16 acres of peaches and cherries.\u00a0 Since then, we have grown the company exponentially and ship our fruit to all major domestic markets and international markets.\u00a0 Currently, the company is owned and operated by brothers Allen and Dana Brandt.\u00a0 Allen is the CEO and Dana is Vice President of Operations.\n\nCONTACT\n\nWE ARE GLAD TO HEAR FROM YOU.\n\nCORPORATE OFFICE / MAIN PACKING PLANT\n\nEW Brandt & Sons, Inc.\n560 Lateral B Road\nWapato, WA 98951\n\nTEL (509) 877-3193\n\nPLANT ONE\n\nEW Brandt & Sons, Inc.\n561 Ragan Road\nWapato, WA 98951\n\nTEL (509) 877-3193\n\nPLANT TWO\n\nEW Brandt & Sons, Inc.\n1284 Ashue Road\nWapato, WA 98951\n\nTEL (509) 877-6931\n\nMAILING ADDRESS\n\nP.O.

When that happens, there can be many implications throughout the production line. One such a case came to us from a major cereal producer who had downsized the fill but needed to keep the store facing space. Once the cases were filled with cartons, the footprint to height ratio made the case unstable on its own. With a long distance from the case packer to the palletizer, ups, downs and turns caused the cases to tip over and stop the line.\n\nThe solution in the customers mind was to combine multiple cases together creating a bundle that could travel in a stable condition. With pallet patterns being different for different SKU's, they asked about combining cases in groups of 2 or 3 and allow pass-through capability for more stable cases. In testing, they discovered they could glue cases together with an adhesive that would hold the cases through transport, be palletized and stretch wrapped. 24 hours later, the adhesive would dissolve, and all the cases would be singles again, ready for distribution.\n\nThe Emerald team brainstormed with the customer to develop a methodology that would outpace the capability of the case packer. Unlike typical adhesive that sets in less than a second, we needed about 2.5 seconds of compression for this formula.\n\nThe Combiner accepts up to 16 cases per minute, allowing the first case into the compression, moved out of the way to allow a second case to have adhesive applied and combined with the first with dual servo controlled overhead compression plates. A third case is released, glued and combined with the first two. The bundle is released to a rotator section where the bundle is turned 90\u00b0 either clockwise or counterclockwise.\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA fulfillment company came to Emerald Automation to find a machine that would load bags of various products into standard RSC cases. As a FANUC Authorized Integrator, we offered a solution to use a robot with a spatula as an end effector.\n\nAfter accepting filled and sealed bags, we grabbed the completed bag and laid it down on a bag checkweigher infeed. The bag is then checked for proper weight and transferred onto an incline conveyor up to the robot tool. When the bag reaches the top of the conveyor, the bag is deposited onto the spatula tool. With the bag in place, the Robot moves, inserting the end arm and tool into the box, tilting the tool to leave the bag flat at one end of the case. On the next bag, the robot places the bag at the other end of the case, creating a 2 x 1 layer pattern. The process continues until the proper bag count is achieved. Depending on the order, they can load as little as 10 or up to 42 bags per case.\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith more and more focus being put on Sanitary Designs for food production facilities, Emerald responded by changing our Dash-DP wash-down design to eliminate tubular frames and moved to an open design to eliminate the opportunity for bacteria to settle and collect in tight locations where chemicals and water can't get. The formed Stainless Plates and standoffs leave plenty of room to apply cleaning chemicals and water to rinse the machines. We even upgraded the electrical components to stainless construction, eliminating the need to bag parts of the packer or the whole packer during clean-up. This saves time for the operators to get the job done.\n\n\n\n\nHere at Emerald Automation, we listen to the needs of our customer to build machinery to live in their \"real world\" environment. We didn't just take the existing design and make it somewhat wash-down, we started with a clean sheet. If you have a need for a sanitary design casepacker, give us a call or email us at sales@emeraldautomation.com.\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA customer came to Emerald needing a Bulk Product Case Packer (Dash-BP).
