Pulses, including peas, lentils, chickpeas, and beans, emerge as the frontrunners for discerning pet owners. Not only do these legumes offer functional processing attributes, antioxidant properties, and wide availability, but they also align with the growing consumer demand for sustainable pet food options. Consumers, increasingly mindful of their pets' health, seek plant-based protein alternatives, making pulses a natural and beneficial addition to pet food formulations.\n\n\u200b\n\nHome\nAbout\nProducts\nOur Facilities\nContact Us\n\n\u00a92023 by BIG SKY MILLING\n\nPrivacy Policy"

Book Me In!\nWrite a Review\nVictoria MacLean\nJanuary 14, 2025\nThis experience was extremely professional, personalized and made simple. I would recommend this service to any mom looking to save their stash and keep the freezer clear. The marketing materials with the personalized water measurements and information about my milk is so cool! I didn\u2019t opt for the nutrient analysis based on my budget but that would be super cool, especially if freeze drying is in your benefits plan. Janna can provide an estimate and receipt for your insurance claim - under health spending, lactation services, nutritional services and maybe kinesiology.\nnatalie hawkins\nDecember 18, 2024\nJust do it! 100% worth it to extend the life of your breastmilk by freezedrying it. Janna is incredibly kind and I've received the absolute best customer service.\nJessica Anderson\nNovember 29, 2024\nTo preface my experience, my breastfeeding journey with my first daughter was not nearly as plentiful as this second time around. With that, I\u2019ve been a bit anxious sort of anticipating my supply to just plummet and so I wanted to explore my options for how else I can get breast milk into my daughter #2 ideally for the first 12 months. I came across Booby Food and was immediately intrigued. Not only do I now have my own freeze-dried breast milk that will stay good for 3-5 years, I now - to my husband\u2019s delight - have room for frozen food in my freezer! The team at Booby Food completely went above and beyond and exceeded my expectations. Beginning with the online purchase + intake form, the process was simple, professional, and efficient. I was amazed at how streamline the receiving shipping cooler/packing of the milk/drop off at Fed Ex/delivery of freeze-dried product was. I was in awe of the packaging (never thought a box of breast milk would make my eyes water, but here we are\u2026) and easy-to-follow directions upon receipt of dried milk (I also appreciate the included personalized nutritional info about my milk). The care and attention to detail from the Booby Food team is very apparent. It is clear the team are passionate about what they do day in and day out and truly want the - dare I say - best nutrition for your babe, for as along as possible. I am still breastfeeding so I have not yet needed to dip into my freeze-dried stash - although I\u2019d like to dabble with making a diaper rash paste in the coming days for my little one. I extend a very heartfelt thank you to everyone involved in producing my freeze-dried milk stash, and of course thank you Janna, for starting such an incredible business in the first place for all us mamas to use. I\u2019m not sure if we are still growing our family but if I have another baby, my path with Booby Food will cross again. If you have a freezer of breast milk and don\u2019t think you\u2019ll use it all up, I highly highly recommend considering taking advantage of Booby Food\u2019s service.\nKelly Mares\nNovember 1, 2024\nI was so nervous about sending my milk all the way from Texas but Janna and her team were absolutely amazing!! They answered any all questions or concerns I had and my milk made it there safe and fast! My baby wouldn't drink my milk that was frozen and today she drank some and actually wanted more! Such a blessing! This was such an amazing process! I saved so much of my milk that I worked so hard to save up! Booby Food is an amazing company and I honestly couldn't have been more happy! I will definitely be using with my next baby!\nGaurav Modi\nOctober 3, 2024\nErin Menear\nSeptember 24, 2024\nThey are so great! Love the amount of communication and attentiveness to their customers.\nCarly Jackson\nMarch 22, 2024\nHighly recommend Booby Food. Janna is amazing, as is the rest of her staff. Super knowledgable and helpful. I have sent in 600oz x 2 of frozen breast milk to have freeze dried for my little one. Will continue to use this service with our next kids.\nAbigail Scott\nMarch 16, 2024\nJanna is exceptionally thorough, kind and detail oriented! The return package with the freeze dried milk far exceeded my expectations - it was organized, well labelled and informative (and bonus - filled with well branded accessories). I would recommend everyone take advantage of this service!\nEmily Walsh\nDecember 7, 2023\nI could not suggest booby food more! The process was seamless and easy to understand and they were available every step of the way. I had an issue when I went to ship the box of frozen milk and someone from booby milk responded within a minute (not even joking) even though it was close to 10pm CST. It wasn\u2019t even their fault, it was the shipping carriers misunderstanding and booby food got it figured out very quickly. Can\u2019t wait to send more milk their way if I ever have an over supply of frozen milk again! Update: We recently traveled and I can not speak more highly of how easy it was to travel with booby food and not have to worry about bringing premade bottles for my daughter.\nNicole Ellerbrock\nDecember 7, 2023\nJana was amazing to work with and so is her customer service team. They answered all my questions, and the information on Booby Food\u2019s IG and website is so thorough! I\u2019m so glad I get to feed my next baby a little milk from my first (when she started refusing bottles I stopped giving her my hard earned breastmilk).

Book My Service, Now!\nRescue \"Older\" Breastmilk from Your Freezer\nYes, you can freeze-dry breastmilk older than 12 months!\n\nFor older milk, current guidelines on expressed breastmilk storage state that breastmilk 6-12m is of the highest quality, and \u201cfreezing keeps food safe almost indefinitely.\u201d\nA.K.A. Your breastmilk does not expire.\n\nHow Old is Too Old?\n\nIf your stash is under 12 months you can still use it for a bottle (even if stored in an upright/top freezer).\n\nBreastmilk older than 12 months may have reduced nutritional value than when freshly expressed, but it is not expired and hasn\u2019t \u201cgone bad,\u201d which is a common misconception.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFor stashes older than 12m it's recommended to use your freeze-dried breastmilk in your babe's foods as they grow.\n\nYahhhhs!!

I had been adding a couple of tablespoons of an upcycled barley flour for about a year now. I liked the added flavor with the carbo-reduced flour I use.\nYours definitely adds a good, new level of flavor as I hoped. A good choice for me. Keep up the good work.\nJim in Reno, NV\n\nAnonymous\n\nLove the way it makes my skin feel\n\nNancy Friede\nBorn again Brownies.\n\nThese are very different from your regular rich (sickly) Brownies! They're just the right sweetness and notes of coffee filtering through the chocolate! The slight texture adds dimension, for an overall taste treat packed with Fibre and protein! Onto the carrot cake mix next!\n\nLeah mitchell\nMust have\n\nAbsolutely love this product. Evens out my skin tone and gives it a fresh glow. Been using it for over a year now and not sure how many I have gifted -it\u2019s a game changer.\n\nSanja Joly\nDelicious pancakes!\n\nI just made the last batch of pancakes from my first bag of this pancake mix, and I love them. They taste great - much deeper flavour than white flour pancakes. And they\u2019re easy to make - just add water! I highly recommend, especially for folks who like the Kodiak high-protein pancakes.\n\nBrian Rowland\nGreat protein pancake!\n\nI was a big consumer of the kodiak cakes this is a great new option for my pantry!\n\nJoel Sherlock\nThe perfect addition.\n\nI love exploring new recipes with a little coffee flour, from chocolate chip cookies to the recent croissant recipe that was posted.\n\nJoel Sherlock\nLove this stuff\n\nThis is my 4th purchase, great for skin and hair. I personally love the slight coffee scent.\n\nJoel Sherlock\nBest Brownies!!!\n\nThe kids love these brownies! This says a lot with my gang of picky kiddos. They are delicious, easy to make and best of all are packed with some extra protein!\n\nMary Burch\nLove the product (I always change the oil)\n\nI am a big fan of these brownies, I do always change out the oil for Olive oil and I add sea salt to the top. I also bake them in muffin tins for a bit size option with more crust!\n\nJoel Sherlock\nbrownies\n\nmy boyfriend tried the brownies and initially didn\u2019t like them. however, upon reviewing them he said they were very good !!!!\n\nI was wrong\n\nI admit my fault for trying to put down this growing buisness that\u2019s only looking to do their part in helping our planet and the brownies were okay\n\nC.\nHoly Grail! Coffee Oil Hand Lotion\n\nThis hand lotion is the first lotion I have used that keeps my hands feeling soft for hours, actually heals my chapped dry winter hands, and doesn't leave a greasy feel, just soft silky skin! The scent of coffee and vanilla are so lovely, and great for sensitive skin as there is no added fragrance. I cannot wait to try all of the other skin care products in this line-up.\n\nTara Belland\n \nSubscribe for special offers and announcements!\nEmail\nFacebook\nInstagram\nTikTok\nTwitter\nTumblr\nCountry/region\nCAD $ | Canada\n\u00a9 2025, GroundUp Powered by Shopify"

All protein latte mixes are the added touch to my coffee bar, that I didn\u2019t know I needed!\n\n \nChristine\n \nSo tasty!\n\nThis mix is insanely good. I find it hard not to chug it. I love that it\u2019s healthy and helps with my sweet tooth.\n\n \nLora W.\n \nA pudding worth its pudding\n\nFirst time having it and it is fabulous. My bestie loves it too. I added a few strawberries and it made a lovely dessert.\n\n \nJulia\n \nLove guilt free icing!\n\nI love making the icing into a single serve cream cheese icing and using on the banana bread (which I also make as a single serve recipe for lunch) \u2026or even by itself when I\u2019m really craving something sweet. I\u2019ve also mixed it into overnight oats or yogurt (along with some other flavors) which is delicious.\n\n \nLori\n \nA Hug in a Mug\n\nI wasn't sure what to expect with the golden latte, but I'm so glad I gave it a try! It's quickly become one of my favorites\u2014absolutely delicious and truly like a hug in a cup. I\u2019ll definitely be reordering it and making it a regular part of my morning or afternoon routine. It's hard to believe there's no sugar, yet it's packed with protein!\n\n \nLori\n \nTastes so good it\u2019s like a treat!\n\nI was shocked when I tried the chai latte beverage. It is so delicious that I could not believe it was good for me. I had to go back and look at the nutritional value to make sure I had read correctly. I have tried with so many different milks and it always taste good but my favourite is with fair life skim lactose free milk.. I am obsessed\u2026 Definitely recommend!\n\n \nKaelyn D.\n \nPerfect for any time of the day.\n\nI absolutely loved this blend. The only down fall I have, is it kinda of hard to emulsify if you don\u2019t have a good mixer. It\u2019s perfect for any time of the day as it contains no caffeine, total up sale for me as it doesn\u2019t affect my anxiety levels. Slay to this amazing business and owners, truly incredible. Just finished the last cup of my bag :(\n\n \nAD\n \nFantastic\n\nI love the pancake in a mug. I also order the cinnamon mix regularly. My only wish was clearer calorie content. 1/12 is a weird measurement and I feel like it could be made easier to interpret for folks. Just tell me a whole bag or grams and then how many grams are in the bag. Thx\n\n \nAD\n \nDelicious\n\nI love this\n\n \nLora W.\n \nChocolate +++\n\nSo simple to make and tastes like a million dollar brownie.\n\n \nOlivia K.\n \nSeriously obsessed!!\n\nHad these brownies for the first time as a sample at a market and I've been hooked ever since! Easy to make and delicious to eat! Always in my cart when I am placing my next order!\n\n \nMiranda\n \nUNREAL\n\nAbsolutely my fave product from Hello Amino, I cannot live without it! I add this to my coffee every morning to make a DELICIOUS mocha. So supportive of my health goals, not only boosting my protein intake but also making that morning cup of coffee so that it has less of a negative impact on cortisol (IYKYK). Absolutely ZERO protein taste, it's hard to believe this is anything other than a gourmet hot chocolate.\n\n \nCourtney M.\n \nTop Notch!\n\nThis is the product that started off my obsession with HelloAmino. I\u2019ve tried almost every product HelloAmino makes but this remains my favourite breakfast item. You really can\u2019t go wrong with HelloAmino but this is my standard and I buy it regularly. Just delicious!\n\n \nArwen C.\n \nGreat matcha\n\nI only bought a single serve package because I find matcha can be hit or miss and when it's a miss it's gross. This, however, smashed it out of the park!!! I'll be buying a big bag on my next purchase. Creamy, subtle, not harsh, great drink.\n\n \nGwenyth L.\n \nExcellent Banana Bread\n\nAn easy and delicious protein bread for a quick tasty breakfast or afternoon snack. I love it toasted with nut butter, or for an extra treat, slather with a bit of the protein icing. Pair it with Protein Chai tea and your day is off to a great start.\n\n \n \nOur Customers Come From All Over!\n\nThe interactive map below shows were our products have been shipped!

Missy stays in shape by consistent ground work but wouldn\u2019t look as good as she does without her AlfaTec Cubes!! I feed them 2x a day and hay at night. They help keep her belly tight, her insides healthy due to no fillers in her feed and her skin seems to shine more\n\nBridget Simon\n\nUsing ALFA TEC products, helps to keep Radar in top shape. I can easily monitor his intake and increase or decrease the amounts he requires, depending on his conditioning required. Super easy to measure and great product for a small Equine.

He is an all-around pony, mainly being a driving pony.\n\nClyde, Alberta\nJaycee and Murphy\n\nWe use Alfatec in the barn for ease of use, storage, and dust control. I Love your cubes!

Over the years, the company has built its list of titles, clients, and services, and the company\u2019s 50+ employees are proud to be an integral part of each association\u2019s marketing plans.\n\nA highly skilled workforce is split between Matrix\u2019s headquarters in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and a sales office in Hamilton, Ontario.\u00a0Much of the team has worked with the company for more than five years, and several have been on staff for more than a decade. Each employee plays a critical role in the overall success of every project, with all departments \u2013 from sales, to design, to distribution \u2013 working closely to ensure clients are proud of the final product.\u00a0\n\nThe men and women who work at Matrix Group Publishing Inc. are experts at what they do. They don\u2019t mind hard work; in fact, the more of a magazine\u2019s workload you pass off to them, the better!\u00a0\n\nThey always hit deadlines.\n\nThey always respond to your correspondence.\n\nThey always put in the effort required to create a product that everyone is proud of.\n\nOur team is ready to turn your idea for an association magazine into reality!\n\nJessica Potter\n\nShoshana Weinberg\n\nShannon Savory\n\nAllie Kozub\n\nJenna Collignon\n\nNeil Gottfred\n\nAdvertising Executives\n\nCustom Content that Drives Your Conversation\n\nYou have an association to run \u2013 you\u2019re lobbying; you\u2019re connecting with potential, new, and assisting members; you\u2019re leading your team; and you\u2019re planning your next annual conference and an upcoming webinar.\n\nWe get it. You don\u2019t have the time to create a high-quality publication for your organization. But we do! For 20 years, Matrix Group Publishing Inc. has been collaborating with our clients to design magazines, directories, and buyers\u2019 guides that showcase their mission, members, and accomplishments.\n\nA magazine specific to your organization and industry can work for you:\n\nUse it to connect with ALL of your members, and as a showcase piece at your next AGM or trade show.\nUse it to reach out to potential members, showing them why they should join your organization.\nUse it as a lobbying tool to easily reach sector leaders, the leaders of other organizations, and government.\nUse it to create awareness about the importance of your industry and members to those who may not be aware.\nBeginning, Middle, and End\nMatrix Group Publishing Inc. takes care of everything!\n\nAdvertising\n\nEditorial\n\nDesign\n\nPrinting\n\nDistribution\n\nCollections\n\nConnecting Online\n\nMore Services\n\nAs your publisher, we\u2019ll take care of as little or as much of the work as you need.

Advertising in a magazine specific to transportation equipment \u2013 that is mailed directly to the purchasing powers working in this industry \u2013 will yield results.\n\nTHIS IS THE POWER OF ASSOCIATION-DRIVEN MAGAZINES.\u00a0\n\nAssociation magazines are all about industry. A trucking magazine is going to feature articles about trucking and showcase trucking-related products. This means it\u2019s going to be read by the very people you want to target your trucking-related products to. This example is applicable across the board. Association magazines make good business sense because you know who is reading these magazines so you can target your ads and reap the rewards. Our magazines are all mailed directly to our association clients\u2019 members and most are also scheduled around industry\u00a0events that our associations are involved in. If you want to know more about how we can connect you with industry-specific buying powers, contact us for a list of titles we publish and industries we are experts in.\n\nWant to know more?

We work closely with our customers to understand their needs, design their packaging and help optimize their supply chain. Whether it\u2019s clamshells to protect delicate products, flexible packaging for high-speed packing and cost efficiency or controlled atmosphere packaging to double and even triple shelf-life, we have become a trusted partner to our select group of customers. We will always honour the core values my father instilled: trust, loyalty and hard work.\n\nWHAT WE DO\n\nWe believe fresh food packaging in Western Canada is too expensive due to many layers of mark-up. We also believe there is not enough choice because the industry is dominated by large players who dictate what is available. We help our customers design customized packaging and then source it at factory-direct pricing.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nCLAMSHELLS & TRAYS\n\nThese are the perfect packaging for produce and products that require extra protection.\n\nCOMPOSTABLES\n\nThe need for eco friendly packaging is more important now than ever.\n\nFLEXIBLE PACKAGING\n\nThese include pouches, bags, and rollstock. The most versatile packaging around.\n\nCONTROLLED ATMOSPHERE PACKAGING\n\nDouble or even triple shelf life with controlled atmosphere packaging.\n\nWHY OLAF\n\nWith over 35 years of developing a network of packaging designers and manufacturers, we have compiled the team to get the job done properly and our purchasing power ensures it is also cost-effective. Our process oversees all aspects from design to QC to final delivery. Thus ensuring peace of mind and keeping the project on budget.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDid you know...\n\n85% of shoppers perceive in-store factors (price, packaging, shelf displays) as more influential than out-of-store marketing.\u00a0\n\nGMA, Booz & Co., and SheSpeaks Shopper Marketing 3.0\n\nGET IN TOUCH\n\nHave a product that needs packaging?\n\nReach out\nCONTACT US\n\n1-888-269-7314\ninfo@olafpackaging.com\n\n6 + 8 = \n\nSubmit\n\u00a9Olaf Packaging 2021 // Collin Wo Graphic Design"

In her third year of tending to her bees, they produced an impressive 450 pounds of honey. Knowing the incredible labor that goes into producing even a single teaspoon of honey, she was determined not to let this liquid gold go to waste.\n\nPrior to this, mead had never held a special place in her heart. In fact, she had often dismissed it as unpalatable. However, on a snowy Christmas Day in 2017, she decided to take a chance. She delved into the world of mead crafting, using her own honey as the primary ingredient. To her surprise and delight, the mead that she produced was unlike any other that she and her husband, Eric, had tasted before. For them, it was a revelation.\n\nTheir mead was unique, a flavor profile distinct from the offerings found on the commercial market. It left them curious and craving more. Kristeva was not content with just savoring her newfound passion; she sought to share her creation with others. To do so, she needed unbiased opinions from the most discerning critics: judges at a mead competition.\n\nWith the courage to take a step into the unknown, she submitted her mead to a competition. The anticipation was palpable as the results were announced. To her astonishment and sheer delight, she clinched a gold medal, and the judges provided glowing feedback that lit her path forward. It was a pivotal moment that encouraged Kristeva to follow her newfound dream.\n\nWith fresh determination, she continued crafting mead throughout the year. The following year, she took her passion even further, entering five distinct meads into various competitions. To her joy, each of these meads earned medals, validating her skills and innovative approach.\n\nAs she stood before the judges to collect her fourth medal, a voice from the crowd pierced through the room. \"We want to come drinking at your place!\" The words resonated in her ears, marking a turning point in her journey. It was that precise moment when Kristeva made a life-altering decision: she would embark on the path of making mead on a commercial scale, sharing her unique creations with the world. The Stolen Harvest journey had just begun.\n\nCANADIAN WINE CHAMPIONSHIP WINNERS\u3030\ufe0fCANADIAN WINE CHAMPIONSHIP WINNERS\u3030\ufe0fCANADIAN WINE CHAMPIONSHIP WINNERS\u3030\ufe0fCANADIAN WINE CHAMPIONSHIP WINNERS\u3030\ufe0fCANADIAN WINE CHAMPIONSHIP WINNERS\u3030\ufe0f\nCANADIAN WINE CHAMPIONSHIP WINNERS \u3030\ufe0f\nEMBRACING REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE\n\nAt Stolen Harvest Meadery, Nothing Goes to Waste!\n\nWe are more than just passionate meadmakers; we're dedicated stewards of the land, committed to sustainability and regenerative agriculture practices. It's our belief that every resource should be utilized to its fullest potential, and nothing should go to waste. Here's how we are making a difference to our land through regenerative agriculture and our unique partnership with the help of our feathered friends.\n\n1. Enriching the Soil with Chickens and Turkeys: In our ongoing commitment to regenerative agriculture, we've enlisted the help of some very special assistants \u2013 chickens and turkeys. These hardworking birds play a crucial role in enriching our soil. They roam freely, pecking and scratching, helping to break up compacted soil, and naturally fertilizing it with their droppings. This process enhances soil health and promotes nutrient cycling, ultimately benefiting the quality of the honey and fruit we use in our mead production.\n\n2. Composting Meadmaking Byproducts: Meadmaking generates fruit waste products, such as pomace and leftover fruit pulp. Instead of discarding these valuable resources, we turn them into nutrient-rich compost. Our feathered friends play a part in this process too. They happily devour these byproducts, further breaking them down and turning them into organic matter that enriches the soil. This sustainable practice not only reduces waste but also ensures that our land remains fertile for future harvests. These birds also help control pests and weeds, reducing our reliance on chemical interventions.\n\n3. Supporting Local Ecosystems: Our regenerative agriculture practices extend beyond our immediate needs. We have kept natural ponds and managed the land so there are many natural areas for wildlife to not only visit but also to make their homes on the land. By providing a habitat for wildlife, we contribute to local biodiversity and promote a balanced ecosystem. We have seen a marked increase in wild birds, bats, toads, dragon flies, and frogs. \n\n4. Enhancing Sustainability: Stolen Harvest Meadery believes in the concept of \"closed-loop sustainability.\" In this system, we aim to minimize waste and maximize resource utilization. The integration of chickens and turkeys into our agricultural practices is just one example of how we're reducing our environmental footprint.\n\n5. A Commitment to Quality: Our dedication to regenerative agriculture isn't just about being eco-conscious; it's also about ensuring the highest quality ingredients for our meads. Healthy soil, rich in nutrients, results in better fruit and honey, which in turn translates into superior mead. It's a win-win for the environment and our products.\n\nAt Stolen Harvest Meadery, we take great pride in our commitment to regenerative agriculture. We believe that nature's bounty should be honored and nothing should go to waste. Through the innovative use of chickens and turkeys in our agricultural practices, we're not only crafting exceptional meads but also nurturing the land that sustains us.\n\nBy choosing Stolen Harvest Meadery, you're not just savoring delicious mead; you're supporting a sustainable, regenerative approach to agriculture that helps preserve the environment for generations to come. We invite you to join us on this journey toward a more sustainable, responsible, and flavorful future. Cheers to a world where nothing goes to waste, and every resource is valued!\n\nFERMENTATION PHILOSOPHY\nTHE ULTIMATE EXPERIENCE IN TERRIOR\u3030\ufe0fTHE ULTIMATE EXPERIENCE IN TERRIOR\u3030\ufe0fTHE ULTIMATE EXPERIENCE IN TERRIOR\u3030\ufe0fTHE ULTIMATE EXPERIENCE IN TERRIOR\u3030\ufe0fTHE ULTIMATE EXPERIENCE IN TERRIOR\u3030\ufe0fTHE ULTIMATE EXPERIENCE IN TERRIOR\u3030\ufe0f\nTHE ULTIMATE EXPERIENCE IN TERRIOR \u3030\ufe0f\n\nWell made meads can delight the senses and raise the tasting experience from ordinary to incredible \u2013 the difference of a well-crafted product is truly amazing. We believe that great meads begin with great honey. And the Canadian Prairies produce great honeys. \n\nWe take our time to source the highest quality products from local sustainable farms. Once a year we make our Special Reserve meads whose ingredients sourced exclusively from the wild.\u00a0\u00a0Stolen Harvest Mead produces the highest quality mead with a view to creating unique tasting experiences for our clientele. \n\nA single honeybee produces a meagre twelfth of a teaspoon of honey per day so each drop is precious. The honey used determines the overarching flavour of the mead, and can vary according to a honey bee\u2019s particular diet of nectar and pollen. Drinking honey wine is the ultimate experience in \u201cTerroir\u201d. \n\nTHE POLITICS OF MEAD\nDRINK LOCAL\u3030\ufe0fDRINK LOCAL\u3030\ufe0fDRINK LOCAL\u3030\ufe0fDRINK LOCAL\u3030\ufe0fDRINK LOCAL\u3030\ufe0fDRINK LOCAL\u3030\ufe0fDRINK LOCAL\u3030\ufe0fDRINK LOCAL\u3030\ufe0fDRINK LOCAL\u3030\ufe0fDRINK LOCAL\u3030\ufe0fDRINK LOCAL\u3030\ufe0fDRINK LOCAL\u3030\ufe0f\nDRINK LOCAL \u3030\ufe0f\n\nThe per capita consumption of honey in Canada is only one kilo (2.2 pounds) per year--we aim to raise that! Who would have thought that by making and drinking mead we could be part of a political movement. From saving the bees to increasing economic development.\u00a0In each bottle of mead there is anywhere from two and a half to nearly six pounds of fruit or berries and between a half to two pounds of honey. This mixture is magically converted to alcohol by specially chosen yeast strains. By choosing a local mead instead of an imported one, you are not only keeping your money in your community and supporting local farms and beekeepers, but also diversifying our economy.\n\nPRESS\n\nWine Align - Results of 2023 winners!\n\nGo Solo Magazine \n\nThe Tomato - Mead, a Honey of a Drink\n\nEdmonton Journal - Honey flows into gold medals for Alberta's Stolen Harvest Meadery\n\nEverything GP - Stolen Harvest gains International acclaim with three gold medals at the World Mead Challenge 2020\n\nDaily Herald Tribune - Mead Maker strikes gold while mastering her craft\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELAX.UNWIND. UNPLUG.\n\nAT THE MEADERY\n\nLocated in scenic Grovedale, Alberta, Stolen Harvest Meadery is hand carved from the Alberta boreal forest: it is ten acres of a rural oasis.  There are hand planted gardens with a wide variety of vegetables and numerous heritage garlics growing. There is a fruit forest as well as a newly planted orchard (2018) with Saskatoons, haskaps, and prairie cherries. Each spring, the fields come alive with a symphony of wildflowers. Some, such as dandelions and wild roses, are lovingly harvested each year in anticipation of the moment when water, yeast, and local raw wildflower honey come together and magic unfolds. The property is adjacent to a larger forest where mother nature provides a bounty wild edibles, some of which make it into our micro-batch hand crafted meads. \n\nHOSTS\n\nKristeva - is a well-traveled anthropologist with a sense of adventure and a bland food phobia. She spent many years wandering the globe in search of foreign cultures and culinary adventures. She is the author of Chicken Poop for the Soul: in search of food sovereignty. The story of her self-sufficient journey towards independence by learning how to hunt, gather, and raise all her own food. What started as an experiment for a book quickly became a passion and a way of life for her. She enjoys taking  wine-lovers outside their comfort zone by introducing them to her wildly inspired meads. \u00a0\n\nEric  - An experienced forager, Eric can teach you how to find wild edibles even in your front lawn\u2014a skill that gets put to use when searching for wild foraged flavours for their mead. From the sea-scapes of his family summer retreat in Cape Breton to the wilderness of Northern Ontario where he spent six months living alone in the wilderness, he has gathered from nature a variety of wild edibles. He has worked in the food industry for more than 20 years in both the role of chef and butcher. His newest passion is charcuterie and pairing his creations with Stolen Harvest Meads.\u00a0\n\nSTOLEN HARVEST MEADERY\n\n69156 RR 63\n\nGrovedale, AB T0H-1X0\n\nSTOLEN HARVEST MEADERY\n\nPO Box 348\n\nGrovedale, AB T0H-1X0\nemail: info@stolenharvest.com\nphone: 780-380-7776\n\n\nWORKSHOPS\nCONTACT\nNEWSLETTER\nFAQ\nStolen Harvest Meadery 69156 RR63, Grovdale, AB, Canada (780) 380-7776 kristevaskitchen@gmail.com\nAGE BARRIER\nPOWERED BY SQUARESPACE"

His folks would take extended holidays in the winter, and would leave him with a freezer full of food, some cash for fresh groceries, and a number of cookbooks. He very quickly learned what went with what, and always enjoyed creating new combinations, some worked, many didn\u2019t at first, but he ate them anyways!\u00a0\n\n\u200b\n\nHe stole his wife Naomi\u2019s heart with Italian chicken breasts with mushrooms and mozzarella cheese with Caesar salad, and the rest is history! His family\u2019s idea of a holiday generally centered around where we could go to enjoy new cultures and exciting food experiences.\n\n\u200b\n\nNaomi was fortunate enough to be raised in a household where food meant comfort and love. She learned to cook with her mother and, later, she and her husband, Eric, passed that love of good food prepared well onto their daughters. Over the years, she and Eric started to develop their own recipes and find great joy in sharing their love of food with friends and family.

The variety of single-protein sources allows pet owners to choose based on their pet's needs if they have any food intolerances. It's wonderful to have multiple options for cats, as high-quality raw cat food options are limited.\"\u00a0\n\nDr. Susan Recker\n\nLead Formulator\n\n\nDVM, Animal Diet Formulator Expert\n\n\n\"It was a pleasure working with Tru-Raw on their formulations, as their goal was not only fresh food diets that are complete and balanced using impeccably-sourced ingredients, but also truly optimized diets. A wide variety of whole foods encourages microbiome diversity, and attention to the nutrient requirements of dogs and cats with varying activity levels ensures proper nutrition is accessible even to lower-activity pets, whose needs are often overlooked. I also appreciate their commitment to transparency -complete nutritional analyses for each formula are readily available, so pet parents and veterinarians can make informed decisions on feeding.\"\n\nDr. Nick Thompson\n\nLead Reviewer\n\nBSc (Vet Sci) Hons, BVM&S,\nVetMFHom, MRCVS.\n\n\n\n\"The Tru-Raw diets I have reviewed are very impressive. Tru-Raw has gone to great lengths to source the cleanest and best-sourced ingredients and carefully blended them to provide a range of great diets for dogs and cats. I would happily feed these diets to my brood of three sighthounds and three moggies. Your choice of food and how it is prepared are cornerstones of health for the whole family, including pets. Tru-Raw offers a powerful range of delicious options to help you optimize health for the furry family in the house.

We involve them in building our process, helping us meet, or exceed our clients expectations and needs.\n\nMission Statement\n\nTo deliver the highest quality services and products to our clients, ensuring we understand their business, their needs and their products. We will achieve this by listening to our clients and recommending the best possible solutions through employee involvement and total accountability for the quality of our services and products.\n\nProudly Family Owned\n\nWhen you buy from a family owned business, you are not helping a CEO buy a third vacation home.\nYou are helping a little girl get dance lessons, a little boy get his hockey jersey, a mom and/or dad put food on the table, a family to pay their mortgage, or a student pay for college.\nOur Customers are our share holders, and they are the ones who we strive to make happy. We may be called a small business, but we have a LARGE capacity for quality and care.\n\nSafety Beliefs\n\nAt X-TREME Packaging, we believe the safety of our employees paramount. Safety is not a program, or a FAD, it is a way of life. Our employee's are trained in and expected to follow safe work procedures at all times. We believe that all employee's should go home in the same condition they arrived at work each day. We have therefore adopted the following as \"Corporate Safety Philosophies\"\n\nBedding Trays\nDisplays\nStock Boxes\nCustom Boxes\nBeer/Wine Advent Callendars\nJumbo Boxes\nPrinting\nWe strive for the highest quality\n\nAt X-TREME Packaging, we have always taken pride in our custom work, having the opportunity to make season ticket boxes for the Calgary Flames and Stampeders was an honour. You don't need a big name to receive the same level of quality though, we use the same quality standards for every customer.\n\n\u00a9 2007-2025 X-TREME Packaging Inc."
