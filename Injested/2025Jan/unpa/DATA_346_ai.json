We call it the gold standard as a nod to Olympic glory and a commitment to excellence. With 25 years of leadership in sport drug testing US anti-doping guru Dr. Don Catlin founded BSCG along with his son Oliver Catlin, a business executive and respected banned substances and dietary supplement expert, and Ryan Connolly, a leading anti-doping, business and civil litigation attorney. The aim was to provide banned substance protection for brands in the nutrition industry to ensure athletes, military service members, first responders and consumers have safe supplement options that contain what they claim and are free of WADA Prohibited Substances and other drug contaminants. Over 20 years BSCG has expanded into a full service third-party certification and testing provider offering banned substance testing, label claims and ingredient verification, environmental contaminant testing, GMP audit and compliance services and more.\n\nINDUSTRY LEADING BANNED SUBSTANCE TESTING\n\nThe BSCG Industry Leading Banned Substance Testing Menu covers more than 507 drugs including 296 on the WADA Prohibited List and 209 Prescription, Over-the-Counter, or Illicit drugs not banned in sport.\n\nPROUDLY RECOGNIZED BY\n\nNIH Office of Dietary Supplements, Drug Free Sport, UFC, LPGA, NBA, CrossFit, U.S. DOD Operation Supplement Safety, Sport Nutrition and Dietitian Japan (SNDJ), Canadian Olympic Committee, Anti-Doping Authority Netherlands, High Performance Sport New Zealand (HPSNZ), New Zealand Defence Force Health, Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA) and others.

The standard tools in the industry to identify materials typically cannot be used to identify botanicals, because with botanicals you are dealing with a species, a genus and even down to a plant part. In order for the product to be efficacious, we have to make sure that we have the proper genus, the proper species and the proper plant part. So one of the only methods in the industry that can test down to that level in detail is TLC, or in our case we\u2019ve invested in the High-Performance TLC machine and that is what we use to identify botanicals.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJenna Farr, Quality Assurance Manager, Nature\u2019s Way Brands\n\nAPPLICATION FIELDS\nHerbal Drug Analysis\nHPTLC is the method of choice for complex matrices, providing visual identity confirmation, rapid sample comparison, adulteration checks, purity monitoring, and marker compound quantification.\nFood Analysis\nHPTLC effectively handles complex and diverse food matrices and is commonly used for quality control, testing for additives, and screening for food contaminants.\nForensic Analysis\nHPTLC enables the rapid and reliable screening of multiple complex biological samples for substances such as drugs of abuse, regulated pharmaceuticals, and other compounds.\nBiotechnology Analysis\nHPTLC is a robust, cost-effective technique for analyzing complex matrices, supporting process control, quality control, and cleaning validation with minimal preparation and multi-mode detection.\nCosmetics Analysis\nHPTLC ensures the quality and authenticity of cosmetic ingredients, such as plant extracts and essential oils, ensuring the safety of cosmetic products.\nPharmaceutical Analysis\nHPTLC efficiently and accurately analyzes multiple samples simultaneously, ensuring high-resolution identification and quantification of active ingredients and impurities.\nChemical Analysis\nHPTLC is used to separate, identify, and quantify chemical compounds in various industries, ensuring product quality.

In addition, I'm now using a giant scoop of Adrenal Cocktail in my morning mason glass jar of water, then adding in a few capsules of Pureway-C anytime I need extra immune system support. I stand behind all of Jigsaw's products.\n\nDr. Decker Weiss\nNaturopathic Cardiologist, Founder of Scottsdale Heart Institute, Peace Possible\n\nFor my practice, magnesium is critical to protect my patients. MagSRT sets itself apart in many ways including the only one to meet the standards a cardiologist such as myself demands. I switched over 3 years ago based on the Scottsdale Magnesium Study results, and have never gone back to any other magnesium product.\n\nDr. Emily Parke\nFounder of Arizona Wellness Medicine\n\nMy patients LOVE using Jigsaw Health products....and so do I. Especially the MagSRT, Adrenal Cocktail, Electrolyte Supreme, and Alaskan Cod Liver Oil supplements!\n\nDr. Keith Chambers\nFounder of Chambers Clinic\n\nWe use the entire spectrum of Jigsaw Health products with our patients. Especially love the convenience of Jigsaw Basic, Jigsaw Complete, and Jigsaw Ultimate.\n\nDr. Sheila Kilbane\nFounder of Infinite Health\n\nI\u2019ve been using MagSRT\u00ae, MagSRT\u00ae B-Free and MagSoothe\u2122 with the kiddos in my clinic and we love them! They are such a great and gentle way to deliver magnesium. My personal favorite and the one I take every day is the MagPure\u00ae Brain Boost. Works like a charm!\u201d Thank you Jigsaw Health for making such incredible products!\n\nDr. Tami Meraglia, MD\nBest Selling Author of \u201cThe Hormone Secret\u201d, CEO of US Stemology\n\nI always keep my family stocked up on Jigsaw MagSRT and CoQ10 and recommend it for all my patients. I love this company! It is rare for a supplement company to do research on effectiveness of a vitamin-they do and have! I appreciate the deep emphasis on quality.\n\nKatie Wells\nFounder of Wellness Mama\n\nJigsaw Health has excellent customer service and a great company culture...I love their products, especially the MagSRT\u00ae -- my personal favorite!\n\nKitty Martone - Healthy Gut Girl\nHost of \"Stuff Your Doctor Should Know\"\n\nAs a wellness expert I pride myself on knowing the best brands of supplements to get the job done. Purity, efficacy, affordability and customer service\u2026 Jigsaw has it in spades!\n\nLance Dreher, PhD\nMr. Universe 1981 & 1986, Mr. America 1981, National Fitness Hall of Fame Inductee 2019\n\nI\u2019ve been in the health and fitness industry for over 50 years and can only say your team at Jigsaw is the BEST! No nutrition company comes close to caring about its customers like Jigsaw! Keep up the caring!\n\nMorley Robbins, MBA, CHC\nCreator of The Root Cause Protocol (RCP)\n\nI recommend many Jigsaw products in the Root Cause Protocol (RCP) Instruction Manual because of the premium quality... and the customer service is fantastic.\n\nTara Hunkin\nFounder of My Child Will Thrive\n\nI can actually get my own kids to take these supplements... they love it!\n\nThomas DeLauer\nKetosis & Intermittent Fasting Author\n\nThe company culture at Jigsaw Health is incredible. The magnesium supplements, Co-Q10, and Brain Boost are a daily MUST for me.\n\nFeatured in...\nAnd we're proud members of:\nClarity up front\n\nWe are not the cheapest. There, we said it.

Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate.\n\nWhat our customers think\nPrevious\nCo-Q10\n\nMy doctor had done the research and advised me to take Jigsaw Co-Q10 a few years ago and I have been very pleased with the results. I also take Jigsaw Purely-C+Lysine which is very superior to anything on the market.\n\nNikki Welles\nQuality\n\nAs with any supplements, quality should always be a focal point. That is why I trust Jigsaw with their processes and their testing. Jigsaw\u2019s CLO is second to none! No \u201cfish burps\u201d and great value for two months worth! Another great product from Jigsaw!\n\nAugustine\nAmazing People delivering an Amazing Product\n\nOwning and operating a Gracie Jiu-Jitsu school and being a Functional Medicine Certified Health Coach, I have seen and taken many supplements over the years.\n\nEveryone I have referred this product to has been impressed and amazed by the quality and positive impact it has made for them. If you ever have the opportunity to meet the people that are delivering this product to the market you will be impressed and amazed by the quality of their character and the positive impact they make on those around them!\n\nJigsaw Health is a stand up company that is owned and operated by stand up people (something that seems to be harder and harder to find in business today). We all have a choice in what we choose to purchase and why we choose to purchase. I choose to research to find the best, and buy from the best. I believe that where and to whom our money goes is an important factor in making purchases in any field.\n\nWhen it comes to my health and the supplements I personally take and recommend, I want the absolute best, purest, and scientifically backed products on the market. I also want my money to go to companies and people that I believe have a strong ethical and moral guidance. If these ideas are important to you as well, look no further and order your Jigsaw MagSRT (and without hesitation) any of the Jigsaw line of products today!\n\nAdam\nI sleep like a baby\n\nI cannot tell you how much MagSoothe has changed my life!! I can finally sleep through the night! Can\u2019t thank your company enough for making such an awesome product\n\nKeri James\nKeep up your ethical work!\n\nI appreciate the fact that you are proud of what you offer and this in fact is what will eventually make an impact to our today's chaotic society.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBesides the products you offer, you are revolutionizing a mentality and I believe that this is more crucial than the products themselves. Because in the end, the products are there for human consumption. And why do we need to be better with supplements if we don't have a human mentality.\n\n\u00a0\n\nKeep up the good work and eventually you will accomplish things that you have not even imagined.\n\nChristos Apostologlou\nLeg cramps\n\nI tried this product because I was having severe leg cramps and everything else I tried didn't work at all. I used this product for 2 days and they were gone, completely!! Best product I have ever used and the customer service is the best I have ever dealt with. I use 4 of their products so far and I love them ALL!!\n\nDarlieh Steinman\nFamily of 8 buys this 6 at a time!\n\nI'm used to dehydrated kids because let's face it, it's much more fun to play than drink water! This electrolyte tastes AMAZING and has the family running back for more. We use about 2 containers a week and buy 6 at a time because it's healthier and cheaper than a hospital visit due to dehydration. If you mix this with the Mag Now powder that Jigsaw offers, you can get two wonderful benefits instead of one. In my house, we call this The Special Drink.....and truly, it is. We\u2019ve been healthy all winter which is nearly impossible for our family size. I TRULY credit our health to Jigsaw!\n\nRos C.\nExceptional quality\n\nI discovered Jigsaw Health in a yoga class. This gal on the mat next to me was using an electrolyte mix in her water. I made the assumption it was an Ultima Electrolyte and was curious what flavor she was using. She informed me it was an electrolyte product by Jigsaw Health and to check out their website. That is all it took. The website and videos are full of relevant information. (Also have you read the bios on the Jigsaw Health Employees--it made the company and their mission statement relatable to me). I also liked the return policy if I was not happy with the products, I could obtain a full refund. How could I not try it with that offer. I decided to \"go all in\" and purchase the Ultimate box.\nI am extremely pleased. I have more energy, digestion has improved and believe the Jigsaw Ultimate are meeting my supplement needs. (note: I did have to cut back on the magnesium from four to two tablets per day but everyone is different).\n\nSandra Walthall\nMost effective daily supplements I have ever used.\n\nI have been using the Essential Daily Packets supplements for several months and have noticed a tremendous difference in my general health and specifically my increased energy level.\n\nIn the past I have used very expensive and proprietary supplements from other companies as well as \"off-the-shelf\"vitamins and they cannot compare to the effectiveness of these from JigsawHealth. I am so glad Dennis Prager commends these products and brings them to our attention so we can improve our health.\n\nJerry S\nLove Love Love it!!\n\nSo convenient to have everything in one packet. Well thought out and is economical compared to buying everything independently. Also love the fact that the company doesn\u2019t cut corners with their quality.\n\nGene I\nGreat product for my patients!\n\nI frequently have patients bring in the supplements they have acquired over the years to perform an audit of their daily regimen. What I see time and time again is sub-therapeutic levels of B-vitamins in an un-methylated form. The switch to Activated-B w/SRT gives my patients the necessary co-factors to run many of the biochemical reactions that are slowed due to nutritional deficiencies, poor absorption, or dietary restrictions. I tell my patients that micronutrients are like the spark plug for their car. The gas and the engine just won\u2019t work together without that spark! Switching to Jigsaw Health\u2019s Activated-B w/SRT has often been the final piece of the puzzle for my more complex patients.\n\nArie Mittman, NMD\nPureway Vitamin C + Lysine! I love this product\n\nRecently, I have found that I am severely immunocompromised and desperately needed to boost and support my immune systems function. I found this product through a friend who recommended it, and within weeks of first taking them, I felt a dramatic positive difference in my overall feelings of health and vitality. I love that there is no sugar, yeast, gluten, etc in this product, and I am very appreciative of their transparency about their process of creating their supplements. I will definitely be a Jigsaw Health supporter for life!\n\nJaime M.\nCo-Q10\n\nMy doctor had done the research and advised me to take Jigsaw Co-Q10 a few years ago and I have been very pleased with the results.

Thus, the company name, Jigsaw Health.\u201d\n\n- Pat Sullivan, Sr.\n\nIt\u2019s discouraging...\nto always feel bad and not know why; to go to doctors and be told there is nothing wrong with you when you know there is.

We promise you, there is hope.\n\nWe out-hug the competition\n\nWhile every company claims to have the best customer service, most companies just want you to be loyal to them.

This category, defined as they are by science, must be supported by scientifically sound product specifications and formulations. It is therefore incumbent upon companies that enter this arena to take up the challenge of offering truly effective products capable of enhancing health.\n\nReishi Mushroom Extract\n\nScientific research into the compounds responsible for Reishi mushroom activity began in the 1970\u2019s in China and Japan. Scientists discovered highly active beta-(1>3)-glucans with the ability to potentiate innate immunity by activating immune cells. Also discovered were secondary metabolites called triterpenoids which were present in significant amounts and sets Reishi apart from all the other medicinal mushrooms.\n\nCordyceps Mushroom Extract\n\nA large body of research as well as traditional use has demonstrated that Cordyceps militaris has similar active compounds and activities to Ophiocordyceps sinensis. Today, for the first time, C. militaris fruiting bodies, rather than mycelium, are available. Not only that, they are being cultivated on substrates free from any insects. It is now absolutely certain that your Cordyceps product is genuine.\n\nLion\u2019s Mane Mushroom Extract\n\nLion\u2019s Mane is a choice edible that grows wild on deciduous trees and is now extensively cultivated on sawdust substrates. Hericium erinaceus is an immunomodulator that is useful for many conditions where immunity is compromised. It has also been traditionally used for stomach ailments. Current research suggests that Hericium erinaceus may help mitigate age related cognitive decline.\n\nSee Our Entire Line of Organic Mushroom Extracts \u00bb\nQUALITY CONTROL IS OUR TOP PRIORITY\n\nWe have worked for over 20 years with our Chinese partners to produce products in a sustainable manner without the use of agricultural chemicals. This has allowed us to reach a quality standard that few other companies can meet.\n\nReview our Quality Control Standards \u00bb\nMUSHROOM EXTRACTS BACKED BY SCIENCE\n\nBecause we focus entirely on mushrooms, we have been able to identify the active compounds in our products with an aggressive program of research and development. Our mushroom extracts are defined by scientific analysis. This means that you can guarantee to your customers that the important active compounds for which mushrooms are well known will be present. The Nammex mushroom testing fingerprint is fast becoming the industry standard.\n\nDiscover Our Recent Research \u00bb\nHOW WE CAN HELP YOU\n\nSince 1989, Nammex has pioneered the development and manufacture of mushroom extracts for the health and wellness industry. Nammex specializes in mushroom ingredients and is the premier supplier of organically certified mushroom extracts.

Our leadership and advocacy actions have helped NASC members attain the highest standards of quality and vigilance and have shaped and secured the future of an industry so many animals rely on to live healthier, happier lives.\n\nOur Mission\nMembership Tiers\nPrimary Suppliers\nNASC Primary Supplier members supply the marketplace with finished animal health and nutritional supplements for dogs, cats and horses. Primary Suppliers that fulfill the requirements of the NASC Quality Audit are eligible to display the yellow NASC Quality Seal on their products and in marketing materials.\nAbout Primary Suppliers\n\u203a\nPreferred Suppliers\nThe NASC Preferred Supplier program qualifies companies providing raw materials, manufacturing, lab testing, and other products and services. NASC Primary Suppliers can confidently source from them without additional vendor qualification. Preferred Suppliers may display the blue NASC Preferred Supplier logo in their marketing.\nAbout Preferred Suppliers\n\u203a\nRegulators\nThe NASC Regulator membership is for employees of state and federal regulatory agencies whose job duties include overseeing animal health and nutritional supplements. It provides NASC resources designed to promote a deeper understanding of the regulatory landscape and foster collaboration that enhances the industry.\nAbout Regulators\n\u203a\nRetailers\nThe NASC Retailer membership is for employees of pet stores, veterinary clinics, farm stores, supermarkets, general merchandise stores, and e-commerce retailers. It provides NASC resources that foster a deeper understanding of animal supplement labeling requirements and claims boundaries, and why the NASC Quality Seal is a credible and trusted mark of quality.\nAbout Retailers\n\u203a\nApply to Join\nThe NASC Quality Seal\n\nMany pet owners today who experience the benefits of supplements want the same for their pets. When it comes to supplements, similar ingredients don\u2019t always mean similar quality. A side-by-side label comparison won\u2019t tell you where ingredients were sourced or whether the supplier has a quality assurance and product testing program in place.\n\nThat\u2019s where the NASC Quality Seal comes in.\n\nLook for the yellow Quality Seal on supplements for dogs, cats and horses to know you\u2019re buying from responsible suppliers that pass a comprehensive third-party audit and maintain ongoing compliance with rigorous NASC quality requirements.\n\nCompanies must earn the NASC Quality Seal\u2014it cannot be purchased.\n\nLearn More\nMember List\nThank You To Our Generous Sponsors!\nContact Us\n\n(760) 751-3360\n\nNational Animal Supplement Council\nPO Box 5168\nSun City West, AZ 85376\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n\nMembership\nPrimary Suppliers\nPreferred Suppliers\nRegulators\nRetailers\nNASC Newsletter\n\nKeep up with NASC news, insights, tips, and more straight to your inbox!\n\nQuality Seal\nBecome a Member\nLog In\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 - National Animal Supplement Council | NASC.

And the main way to demonstrate those attributes is through traceability. Learn why traceability is so effective, which supplement brands are getting it right, and how our 10-step road map can guide your brand's traceability program.\nPODCAST\nNutraCast: Pure Branding Leverages Psychographic Segmentation to Capture Consumer Sentiment\nPublished on August 9, 2024\nDanielle Masterson of NutraIngredients-USA interviews Pure Branding CEO, Yadim Medore, on the importance of psychographic consumer segmentation in the supplement marketplace, where he highlights takeaways from its census-balanced market research that segments and captures supplement consumer attitudes and behaviors pre and post-pandemic.\nARTICLE\nThe Doctor is In (and Everywhere Else Too): All Practitioner Supplement Brands are Now Omnichannel Brands\nby Yadim Medore | Published on October 4, 2023\nThe last decade has been characterized by marketplace adaptation. HCP brands, which previously committed to maintaining exclusivity within the HCP channel, now face the imperative of reevaluating their strategies. Brands must now confront the imperative of enhancing their marketing competencies in both business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) spheres to maintain their relevance and standing in this evolving landscape.\nARTICLE\nFive Tips for Launching a Thriving DTC Supplement Brand This Year\nby Samantha Brewster | Published on February 1, 2024\nTen years ago, the first successful direct-to-consumer (DTC) supplement brands \u2013 like Ritual and Care/of \u2013 were launched in a landscape that is markedly different than today. How can entrepreneurs succeed within a shifting ecosystem where the cost to acquire and sustain customers is incredibly high?\u00a0\nARTICLE\nSupplement Brand Transparency: Think TV Series, Not Movie\nby Peter Littell | Published on June 1, 2023\nMany dietary supplement brands are under the false impression that becoming fully transparent will take years of time, effort, and resources. They believe becoming fully transparent is like making a major motion picture \u2014 years in the making, one all-encompassing story, and expensive. You release it once and hope it makes an impact.

Founded by Principal Asa Waldstein, a dietary supplement expert with 20 years of experience developing and implementing compliant marketing and cGMP manufacturing processes. Asa has formulated, manufactured, and marketed hundreds of products in a compliant manner and has helped oversee three FDA CFR 111 audits without any 483s. Asa decided after years as an executive for other companies the best use of his skills was to open Supplement Advisory Group to serve the greater supplement marketplace.\n\nLearn More\n\nWhat Clients Say\n\n\"Asa Waldstein recently conducted a two-day comprehensive training on dietary supplement labeling regulations for a group at our company. Asa was very informative, presenting a detailed review of the essential information necessary for dietary supplement label compliance. He kept the group engaged and interested by using examples and getting the group involved in exercises to help us assess our comprehension and skills. The presentation stimulated a great deal of productive discussion not only around the regulations but also about risk assessment with respect to labeling and marketing materials. Asa\u2019s commitment to answering follow-up questions and providing continued guidance was especially valuable for ensuring we stayed on track. The training concluded with clear, actionable steps for the team to ensure ongoing compliance and avoid common pitfalls. Asa customized the content to our company\u2019s specific needs, which made the training even more relevant and actionable. \u00a0It was a pleasure to work with Asa, who is a consummate professional, as well as an expert on all things related to the regulations of dietary supplement labeling. We will definitely be calling on him in the future when we are in need of consultation.\"\n\nYalda Shokooh\n\nNow Foods, Director of Science and Nutrition\n\nCONTACT\nSupplement Advisory Group\nFor any general inquiries, please fill in the following contact form:\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nSubject\nMessage\nSubmit\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nVisit AsaWaldstein.com\nfor industry insight & analysis\n\nAmerican Herbal Products Association (AHPA)\n\nand United Natural Products Alliance (UNPA) Member\n\n\u00a9 2024 Supplement Advisory Group.\u00a0\n\nDisclaimer: The educational information provided on this website is for informational purposes only.
