In pursuit of this goal, greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced, at least, to below 5 billion tons CO2 equivalent by about 2050.

In this circular economy, extending product lifespan, reducing the waste at the design stage, recovering and reintroducing products into the supply chain, and expanding our reliance on sustainable materials are key principles that inform the 5R strategy in our circular economy consulting services.\n\t\nLEARN MORE ABOUT OUR CIRCULARITY INTEGRATION SERVICES\nMEET OUR TEAM\nWebinar: Demystifying the Circular Economy\n\nSeptember 12, 2024\n\n\t\nUnlocking the Power of the Circular Economy with ISO 59000 Series\n\nAugust 15, 2024\n\n\t\nOur New Publication on Consumer Behavior toward Plastic Recycling\n\nJuly 11, 2024\n\n\t\nThe Hidden Trade-Offs of Biodegradable Plastics: Balancing GHG Emissions and Ecotoxicity\n\nNovember 14, 2024\n\n\t\nHow Climate Change is Shifting the Baseline for Business Decisions\n\nNovember 8, 2024\n\n\t\nWhy Waiting to Conduct an LCA Could Cost Your Business Millions\n\nOctober 21, 2024\n\n\t\nWebinar: Demystifying the Circular Economy\n\nSeptember 12, 2024\n\n\t\nUnlocking the Power of the Circular Economy with ISO 59000 Series\n\nAugust 15, 2024\n\n\t\nOur New Publication on Consumer Behavior toward Plastic Recycling\n\nJuly 11, 2024\n\n\t\nThe Hidden Trade-Offs of Biodegradable Plastics: Balancing GHG Emissions and Ecotoxicity\n\nNovember 14, 2024\n\n\t\nHow Climate Change is Shifting the Baseline for Business Decisions\n\nNovember 8, 2024\n\n\t\nWhy Waiting to Conduct an LCA Could Cost Your Business Millions\n\nOctober 21, 2024\n\nVIEW ALL POSTS\nConnect with Us Today to Explore How Our Circular Economy R&D and Consulting Services Can Help You Achieve Your Environmental Sustainability Goals.\nBOOK A MEETING NOW\nWe Are a Proud Member of\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n5R Enabler Designs and Operations Inc.\nCircular Economy Consulting\n\t\n\t\nEmail: info@5redo.ca\nPhone: +1 (236) 777-6643\n \nOntario Lab & Office\n70 Dumart Place\nKitchener, ON Canada\n \nQuebec Office\n104 rue Wood\nSherbrooke, QC Canada\n©2020-2024 5R Enabler Designs and Operations Inc.\nEN"

Their consistency excels in providing fantastic customer service, competitive pricing, numerous packaging options and continuous product development. Jeff's caring and honest nature have definitely made him a valuable part of my company’s growth and success.\n\nRyan Herniman, Brand Builder\n\nJeff and his team at Arranti have been very professional and easy to work with through multiple packaging projects. I have found them to be responsive and solid in communication, which is key to keeping project timing on track. In addition, they can be resourceful when need be and often, think ‘outside the box’ in order to get a program completed or to move the needle.\n\nMark Dimitrof\n\nI want to make a big shout-out to Jeff Herrington and Team Arranti! The company's Commitment to Quality, Customer Service and making you feel like you are in the best hands you can be! BTW... the best damn protein pouches, period. They look great and are extremely durable.\n\nJohn Morin, Inner Armour\n\nFrom ink-stained hands, to leading production demands.\n\nTrends come and go, technology evolves, but craft and passion are forever. From the confines of his Dad’s garage, Jeff Herrington first learned the art and craft of printing techniques by hand.\nWith ink-stained fingers, he transformed his father’s legacy into a market leader for printed packaging and design.\n\nThat passion is the foundation of Arranti’s success. While most companies react to trends, Arranti sets them. And, ensures that expertise and passion combine to create something truly remarkable for your products. From advanced printing techniques to pioneering packaging innovations, Arranti delivers superior results to create a custom packaging experience that tells your products’ story.\n\n \n\nMy Biography\n\nLEARN OUR STORY\nOUR PRODUCTS\nFILLING SOLUTIONS\nOUR PROCESS\nWHO WE ARE\nOUR INNOVATIONS\nBLOG\nCONTACT\nPRIVACY\nARRANTI Canada\n\nTORONTO / GTA ONTARIO, CANADA  L0P 1B0\n\nTel:  \n+1.905.854.7421\nEmail:\nINFO@ARRANTI.COM\n\n \n\nARRANTI USA\nCedarburg, WI 53012 USA\nTel:\n414 391 3830\nEmail:\nMARCOSM@ARRANTI.COM\nARRANTI INC.© 2025 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED\nCRAFTED BY CANDYBOX "

Are you ready to go green?\n\nEnvironmentally friendly, compostable clear film and sheet material, EVLON®, is made from NatureWorks PLA Ingeo resin or Total Corbion resin.\n\nMade from plants, EVLON®, fills the worldwide desire to utilize renewable resources and provides an environmentally friendly, crystal clear, strong product that can be used in a variety of packaging applications such as sealed produce bags, confectionary bags, bakery bags and sealed over-wrap.\n\nThe film can be plain or printed and laminated, for horizontal and vertical packaging machines.\n\nEVLON® products can be industrially composted, and the material will breakdown and revert to carbon dioxide and water in less than 90 days.\n\nFood contact certification in USA, EU and Canada.\n\nR&D\nResearch & Development Pre-Production Trial Runs\n\nWe offer a product development facility for customers to develop biaxially and mono direction oriented products. Products can move from the lab environment and into a pre-production phase for assessment and modifications to achieve the desired physical properties. \n\nCapabilities are a biaxial orientation line and a mono direction line, capable of laminating additional layers on to sheet as well as extruding and orienting sheet and film in large quantities. \n\n \n\nThe facility has been used by several of the world's largest petrochemical, packaging and food companies.\n\nAptra®\nAPTRA® Breathable Film\n\nBI-AX manufactures Aptra® Classic and Aptra® UV films.\n\nAptra® is a breathable film used as a composite with other materials. Though it barely registers on the scales, this unique film provides an exceptional combination of barrier properties and breathability.\n\nAptra® is easily laminated with a wide variety of substrates using several methods. Composite structures utilizing spunbond nonwovens are one of the many configurations possible. Lamination can be accomplished by point bonding with heated calenders, sonic bonding, heat sealing and spray adhesives.\n\nA wide variety of applications: roofing underlayment, housing wrap, disposable protective garments, medical apparel and industrial garments.\n\nMaking evlon compostable film since 2001...doing our part for the environment\nHistory\n30+ Years Manufacturing Biaxially and Mono Oriented Film\n\nBI-AX International Inc. was founded by brothers David and Tom Inglis in 1986 and production of biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) began in 1987. Initial markets were pressure sensitive tape and food packaging.\n\nIn 2000, the operation expanded with a 220,000 square foot plant in Wingham, Ontario, Canada.\nSince then niche markets in product development trials, compostable film ( EVLON® ) and breathable, microporous products (Aptra® ) have dominated our business.\n\nAnother capability is mono-directional orientation of heavy sheet with the ability to add extra layers. This can be done with sheet that has been made in other locations with various layer configurations.\n\nRecently we added the availability of GMO-free PLA resin for our EVLON line of products.\n\nMuch of our time is used in toll manufacturing for other companies that require production of their specialty products. This is a more economical way for them to enter a growing market than the purchase of expensive equipment.\n\nContact us for your packaging or R&D Needs\nEvlon compostable packaging film from renewable resources\nPackaging made with Evlon compostable film\nCoffee pods made from Evlon compostable film\nAn idea of the types of products that can be packaged with Evlon Compostable film\nTake out containers made with Evlon compostable packaging film\nExcellent barrier properties make Evlon compostable film suitable for food and non-food packaging\nExcellent moisture and aroma barrier properties, strength, twist retention, gloss and deadfold are all characteristics of Evlon compostable packaging film.\nEvlon film is made from renewable resources.\nRun trials for potential commercial application\nMono Direction Orientation, laminating, mono direction stretching film/sheet\nBiaxially oriented film, 4 m wide, 3 layers ABC\nAptra resin\nBI-AX - a progressive company\nEvlon compostable packaging film from renewable resources\nPackaging made with Evlon compostable film\nCoffee pods made from Evlon compostable film\nAn idea of the types of products that can be packaged with Evlon Compostable film\nTake out containers made with Evlon compostable packaging film\nExcellent barrier properties make Evlon compostable film suitable for food and non-food packaging\nExcellent moisture and aroma barrier properties, strength, twist retention, gloss and deadfold are all characteristics of Evlon compostable packaging film.\nEvlon film is made from renewable resources.\nRun trials for potential commercial application\nMono Direction Orientation, laminating, mono direction stretching film/sheet\nBiaxially oriented film, 4 m wide, 3 layers ABC\nAptra resin\nBI-AX - a progressive company\nEvlon compostable packaging film from renewable resources\nPackaging made with Evlon compostable film\nCoffee pods made from Evlon compostable film\nAn idea of the types of products that can be packaged with Evlon Compostable film\nTake out containers made with Evlon compostable packaging film\nExcellent barrier properties make Evlon compostable film suitable for food and non-food packaging\nExcellent moisture and aroma barrier properties, strength, twist retention, gloss and deadfold are all characteristics of Evlon compostable packaging film.\nEvlon film is made from renewable resources.\nRun trials for potential commercial application\nMono Direction Orientation, laminating, mono direction stretching film/sheet\nBiaxially oriented film, 4 m wide, 3 layers ABC\nAptra resin\nBI-AX - a progressive company\nTranslate\n© 2025 BI-AX International Inc: Compostable packaging film, Aptra used in garments to prevent spread of infectious diseases and R&D facility for pre-commercial purposes | Powered by Beaver Builder"

While experts suggest that there is no way to predict the winning numbers accurately, it's fascinating to examine the most drawn keno numbers https://nz-casinoonline.com/blog/most-drawn-keno-numbers-at-nz-online-casinos/.\nIt turns out that certain numbers have consistently come up more frequently than others over the years.\n\nIt's always good to have a game plan while playing, so why not use this data to improve your strategy slightly? Whether you're a seasoned keno player or a newcomer, analyzing the most drawn keno numbers might be worth considering on your next visit to the casino.\nAnd, if all else fails and no numbers seem to be working in your favor, maybe it's time to take a break and drink works, and give Lady Luck a chance to intervene.\n\nW miarę jak świat powoli odchodzi od gier online na rzecz gier mobilnych, gry kasynowe zaczynają podążać za tym trendem. Wiele gier jest obecnie tworzonych z myślą o urządzeniach mobilnych, co oznacza, że są one projektowane na mniejszy ekran, a następnie dostosowywane do trybu online.\nJednak spośród tysięcy gier, które są dostępne w setkach kasyn online, większość z nich została zaprojektowana dla platformy online. Aby umożliwić masową migrację tych gier, stworzono platformę zwaną HTML 5.\nNie wdając się w szczegóły, HTML 5 jest platformą kodowania, która pozwala stronom internetowym, grom, kasyno online Paysafecard i teraz slotom na płynność pomiędzy urządzeniami online i mobilnymi. Oznacza to, że program może być opracowany na tej platformie i dostępny na wielu urządzeniach.\nWszystko to oznacza, że gracz slotów jest teraz w stanie grać w gry na iOS, Android, Windows mobile i każdej innej platformie mobilnej. Gry, w większości, zostały pięknie przeniesione w poprzek i mogą być renderowane, aby dopasować się do każdego rozmiaru ekranu lub rozdzielczości.\nFANTA HALLOWEEN\n\nVIEW PROJECT\n\nEen van de belangrijkste doelen van regelgeving omtrent online gokken is het beschermen van spelers tegen de risico's van gokken. Bedrijven die een vergunning willen verkrijgen, moeten daarom maatregelen nemen om te voorkomen dat spelers te veel geld uitgeven en om problematisch gokgedrag te identificeren en te behandelen. Spelers moeten ook toegang hebben tot informatie over gokverslaving en hulpmiddelen om dit te voorkomen.\nEr zijn verschillende soorten online gokspellen beschikbaar, waaronder videoslots, tafelspellen zoals blackjack en roulette, poker en sportweddenschappen. Elk spel heeft zijn eigen regels en strategieën, en het is belangrijk om deze te begrijpen voordat je begint met spelen. Veel goksites met iDeal bieden gratis versies van spellen aan, zodat je ze kunt uitproberen voordat je begint met echt geld spelen.\n\t\nSHLOER\n\nVIEW PROJECT\n\n\t\nSTONE'S GIN\n\nVIEW PROJECT\n\n\t\nBOTHAM WINES\n\nVIEW PROJECT\n\n\t\n\t\nFANTA\n\nVIEW PROJECT\n\n\n\n© 2025 Drink Works.

Sourced from renewable forests, our wood pulp is biodegradable and contributes to the lifecycle of sustainability by reducing environmental impact.

TRY OUR CREATIVE THINKING WORKSHOP\n\nDO YOU NEED HELP TO CREATE A SUSTAINABLE BRAND?\n\nWHAT  We specialise in taking deep dives with brands to solve their challenges, one by one, using creative thinking. Joining the dots to create the bigger picture. It starts with a conversation. It could end with a brand identity; a new product launch; or a service that creates value in society; or a deeper understanding of who you are and what you stand for. Whatever the challenge, we’ll be on the journey with you and find the way forward together to achieve your goals.\n\nWe get under the skin of exciting organisations looking to do good and help them to overcome their challenges in creative ways, with our Creative Critical Thinking Workshops, unlock the business challenge with a creative solution.\n\nHOW We’re agile (because we work with a network of brilliant independent creatives); we’re energetic (because we only work on projects that get us excited); and we’re committed (because if we’re working with you, we believe in your goals and creating sustainable value in the world).\n\nThat’s all well and good, but the missing link in many consultancies doesn’t crop up in a lot of business processes: empathy. Because strong solutions don’t come from us swooping down and telling you what to do – they come from deep conversation, understanding and true collaboration.\n\nWHAT’S YOUR BUSINESS CHALLENGE FOR 2025?

What are you goals and are you able to leverage your brand to achieve them. Goal posts move, with day to day challenges, sustainability targets and the creating a better world and the demands and needs of your people internally and externally. Refreshing a brand is complex and ‘a brand’ isnt just a logo! By having a conversation about what you want to achieve and why in a business context session will always tease out what is needed and also what the brief needs to be. There is a lot of pressure for people to know what needs changing and most briefs come from looking at where you need to get to and forming a project plan. With analysis, data, research fed into the upfront thinking, we work to form briefs maybe for us maybe for others whose skill set is needed. So to be clear a brand refresh is not always a new logo, it could be a better consumer journey, better signposting and brand awareness, or a new brand identity (which is a new logo)!\n\nREAD MORE\n\nBRAND IDENTITY\n\nWhat makes a good brand identity?\n\nYou can analyse identities and have research things until an inch of their life. A brand identity needs to have meaning and is if you think as a brand, as I do like a person. Everyone is unique, has a personality, decides how to project themselves, has behaviours unique to them, sounds differently. A brand identity is all those things, its the total sum of several elements that sets you apart and tells a story that engages certain people but not others. That’s fine we can’t all be friends with everyone nor would we have enough time to show up. Humanising a brand, an organisation, a non profit, a charity to appeal to other human beings is what we are good at. But like people everyone has a different vibe, different tribes they feel connected to and its getting to the heart of that, in order to really resonate with all your audiences.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nBRAND ACTIVATION\n\nHow do you live engage others with the brand?\n\nHow do you bring ideas to life that are on brand, on mission and ensure you align with your purpose can often be harder than you think. Once your brand is developed, you as a business then have to live your brand. Having a strategic creative in the room that can interpret the brand beforehand and bring new ideas and thoughts to the party can often unlock or allow others in your own organisation to be brave and bold, empowering them to release their creative thoughts in a safe space.\n\nBrand activation will always begin with who the audience in with that you have no idea what will resonate.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nCREATIVE SPRINTS TO SOLVE BUSINESS CHALLENGES\n\nHow do you unlock a challenge using creativity?\n\nHow do you enable teams to think differently than their day to day thought processes. I design and create workshops, with my collaborators around individual business challenges. They can be virtual (we started in Covid and work globally) or in the same venue, choosing a creative space or bring the creativity to you. I draw on lots of agile methods and tested fun exercises to unlock everyone’s creative thoughts. But a sprint session is all well and good if you don’t outline a success criteria and scope out actions afterwards! Any creative sprint will be preloaded and involve a business context session (2 hr sprint) to understand what we need to unlock, who our stakeholders are and what we need to achieve. Using this way of working you can sprint ideas with you and your team.\n\nFrom Owners and founders to marketing you can look at NPD pipeline ideation, all manner of brand challenges from Brand purpose, Brand activation, Brand vision and values, NPD pipeline ideation, to Brand activation. For HR people key challenges – recruitment and retention, reward and recognition. Any challenge can also benefit from a creative in the room to bring a different perspective.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nWEBSITE DEVELOPMENT\n\nAs part of the digital journey we collaborate and bring in a specialist developer that will add value to the build of the project. Every project is very different so in the scoping we would look at the digital build requirements and what we can help with, or if you have some internal resource work with your team. Its as flexible as you need it to be.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nEDUCATION – LECTURING, MENTORING & TALKS\n\nHow do we pay our knowledge forward?\n\nAs a key part of my own journey being inspired by industry professionals, I aim to use some of my time to help fellow creatives, children in education, universities to enrich or bring a new perspective into the room. Please contact me if there’s an opportunity to help in an education, or workplace setting to add value.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM SOLVERS. COMMITTED TO RECYCLING 100% OF OUR PLASTIC, AGAIN AND AGAIN.\n\nIn 1995, our decision to start up a Canadian family-run company with a focus on sustainability just came naturally. Since then, Ice River has been dedicated to producing the highest quality, environmentally responsible bottled water out there.\n\nIce River Sustainable Solutions is known for our forward-thinking innovation in eco-friendly design. By shifting our focus to the plastic bottles that contained our natural spring water, we came up with new ways to recycle 100% of the bottle – right down to the cap. Even when we were told it couldn’t be done. Our green initiatives and our ambition grew from there.\n\nWE SAW GREAT POTENTIAL IN PLASTIC.\n\nWe’re the first North American beverage company to build our own recycling facility, which is how we recycle the PET collected in the Blue Box and give that plastic new purpose. Collaborating with other companies, we produce eco-friendly packaging and products made from 100% recycled PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastic, that are 100% recyclable. It just takes a little innovation and a lot of determination to find more sustainable solutions.\n\nWE’VE KEPT OVER 425 MILLION POUNDS OF PLASTIC OUT OF NORTH AMERICA’S LANDFILLS SINCE 2009.\n\nIt’s worth every effort. Protecting the environment is at the heart of every business decision we make. If we all put in the work, we’ll all be able to enjoy this big, beautiful blue planet for many more generations to come.\n\nDiscover Our Innovations\nPROUD TO BE ONE OF CANADA’S GREENEST EMPLOYERS\nIce River Sustainable Solutions has been named as one of Canada’s Greenest employers for 2023. This coveted award recognizes companies that have ‘green’ ingrained in their DNA, with a commitment to the environment backed up by exceptional sustainability programs and initiatives.\n\nAwarded by Canada’s Top 100 Employers Project\n\nEVERY LITTLE THING ADDS UP.\n\nThe environmental impact of our recycling efforts are the numbers we use to measure our success.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL SAVINGS BY USING 100% RECYCLED PET BOTTLES INSTEAD OF NEW VIRGIN PLASTIC, SINCE 2010.\n2,622,790,540 KWH\nOF ENERGY SAVED\n\nENOUGH TO POWER\n\n217,316\n\nHOMES FOR 1 YEAR\n\n162,798,354 KG CO2E\nOF EMISSIONS AVOIDED\n\nEQUIVALENT TO\n\n4,174,317\n\nTREES PLANTED\nA 78% REDUCTION IN EMISSIONS\n\n1,694,589,346 L\nOF WATER SAVED\n\nTHAT ADDS UP TO\n\n1,687,838\n\nDAILY HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION\n\n425,000,000 LBS\nOF WASTE DIVERTED\n\nFOR A TOTAL OF\n\n20,399\n\nWASTE TRUCKS DIVERTED FROM LANDFILL\nA 78% REDUCTION IN EMISSIONS\n\nSee How We’re Committed to Change\nWE’RE THE LARGEST PRIVATE LABEL BOTTLED WATER PRODUCER IN CANADA.\n\nFor over 25 years, Ice River has been producing private label bottled water for large retailers in Canada – you’ve probably had our water without even realizing it. From major grocery stores to merchandise and food chains, many iconic Canadian brands are proud to put their logo on a 100% recycled plastic bottle.\n\nOUR FAMILY OF COMPANIES GET GREENER AS WE GROW.\n\nIce River Sustainable Solutions sees every environmental challenge as an opportunity.

Knowing that we’re stocking shelves with nutritious, fresh products is what gets us out of bed in the morning. Ensuring our products are nutritious, fresh, and grown with the highest safety standards keeps us moving forward. Because when we do our jobs better, people eat better and live healthier lives. It’s that simple, and it doesn’t get much better than that.”\n\nMatt Quiring,\nSVP Sales and Marketing\n\nGROWING MORE WITH LESS\nThe benefits of\ngreenhouse growing\nDiscover Our Process\nsustainable\nfood system\n\nGreenhouse growing is redefining the way we think about farming. That’s because its foundation is a sustainable food system, which allows us to cultivate produce in a controlled and protected environment, making the most of our resources, cutting waste, and consistently delivering top-quality fruits and veggies. The result? Healthier outcomes for both you and the planet.\n\nvertical\ngrowing\n\nThings always look up when greenhouse clean produce grows in that direction. Vertical greenhouse growing allows us to fit the equivalent of up to 15 acres of field-grown farmland into one acre of space. What’s it all lead up to? Greater efficiency, long-term sustainability, and true optimism for the future.\n\nreduced\nfood miles\n\nWe make sure our farms are close to your grocery stores. When produce arrives faster, it’s bigger on nutrient-density, freshness and flavor. And smaller on our carbon footprint. \n\nFRESH AND TASTY\nRecipes\n\nGet Inspired\n\nZesty Sweet S’NAPS™ Salad\nHiiros™\nBuddha Bowl\nStrawberry\nProtein Pancakes\nZesty Sweet S’NAPS™ Salad\nHiiros™\nBuddha Bowl\nStrawberry\nProtein Pancakes\nZesty Sweet S’NAPS™ Salad\nHiiros™\nBuddha Bowl\nStrawberry\nProtein Pancakes\nZesty Sweet S’NAPS™ Salad\nHiiros™\nBuddha Bowl\nStrawberry\nProtein Pancakes\nZesty Sweet S’NAPS™ Salad\nHiiros™\nBuddha Bowl\nStrawberry\nProtein Pancakes\nAWARD WINNING FLAVOR\nHiiros\n\nA new Tomato has taken the produce department by storm!

Transformation. Glass Packaging.\n\nGlass is a material unlike any other, capable of creating stunning, memorable experiences, and it’s the most sustainable packaging material on earth. At O-I, we have a history of transforming how the world stores food and beverages – of making glass more accessible to more customers and consumers. We reimagine how glass is made and sold by innovating production techniques, pioneering recycling and sustainable technology, and unleashing the iconic, brand-building potential of this packaging that is the kindest material for the planet and its people.\n\nRead Our Story\nOUR VISION\nShaping the Future Through Glass\n\nWe create iconic, healthy glass packaging so synonymous with brands, you recognize those brands by their packaging alone, even without a label. We innovate packaging design to enable customers to meet their own ambitions, from connecting with consumers on an emotional level to creating a more sustainable future.\n\nLearn Our Vision\nInnovation at O-I\nOUR STORY\nDriven Through Innovation\n\nInnovation and transformation are in our DNA. O-I Glass was founded more than a century ago by a man whose glass bottle making machine was called the most significant invention in glass in 2000 years. Founder Michael J. Owens’ motto was “It can be done.” And we’re doing it. We’re reimaging what glass can do, making it the world’s most versatile, charismatic and sustainable packaging material.\n\nOUR MISSION\nOur Sustainability Vision\n\nGlass is the ideal packaging material to support a low-waste, circular economy. But sustainability isn’t just about what we make – it’s also about how we make it. Sustainability is woven into everything we do, from transforming our glass-making technology and processes to our customer approach to how we engage our employees and support our communities.\n\nLearn Our Mission\n1\n2\n3\nPower of\nGlass Packaging\n\nGlass is pure, sustainable, and the kindest packaging material for the health of people and the planet. Glass has an element of magic to it. It is beautiful and iconic. It can turn into shapes. It plays with the senses. Glass is 100% recyclable and infinitely recyclable. It does not increase ocean pollution. Glass is virtually inert, which means it doesn’t interact with the foods and beverages it holds.\n\nWe love glass and we aspire to create a healthier, more sustainable, and more exciting world through glass packaging.\n\nDiscover Benefits of Glass\nGuided by Our Values\n\nAt O-I, we deeply care about our people and our culture. Guided by our values and behaviors, we’re constantly seeking to transform how we support and engage employees and the communities in which we work and live.\n\nSee Our Careers\nStay Connected\n\nFollow along on social media as we transform glass packaging and discover what’s possible with glass.\n\nMake 2025 the year of fewer microplastics by...\n\n 4  0\nOpen\n\nAnyone focused on #cleanliving in 2025?

He was a champion for me during my career transition, helping connect me to an amazing opportunity within the renewable energy space. Careful attention to detail, an energetic follow-through, and a willingness to listen made a real difference for me in navigating the interview and offer process.\nAdding that personal touch, it felt that Nic and his team were always interested in helping me accomplish my personal goals rather than just fill an open position. I would recommend working with Nic for any company looking to fill a position and any professional looking to take the next step of their career.”\n\nRobin Gray\nChief Technology Officer\nSoltage, LLC\n{\n\n“John and his team were a pleasure to work with, and most importantly, we were able to attract a top-tier candidate that fully met our requirements.”\n\nJoan Hutchinson\nManaging Director, Off-take Advisory\nMarathon Capital\n{\n\n“TRANSEARCH has been a trusted business partner for Golder over the years. Chris recruited me for Golder as the company’s first external CEO. Since then, he has helped fill a number of key executive positions for the company and two external director positions on our board. Chris is thorough and has a deep understanding of our business and culture. He is brutally honest and has consistently looked out for the best interest of our company. I strongly recommend him and TRANSEARCH.”\n\nHisham Mahmoud\nCEO\nGolder Associates\n{\n\n“I have worked with Nicole for over ten years, first as a recruit and then as a client. The biggest differentiator for Nicole is that she works to not only understand the job that she needs to fill, but also the culture and leadership that the role will fit into. Understanding the culture makes sure that the client, as well as the recruit, are successful. Nicole also understands the business and how the roles she is helping with will support that business. Nicole is thorough, professional, and engaging on a personal level. Overall – a great resource to have in your corner.”\n\nNishat Ahmed\nVice President, Quality\nM.C. Dean, Inc.\n{\n\n“From the moment Nicole reached out to me to the day I received my offer letter with my new company, she was with me every step of the way. Nicole has a very professional, confident, and reassuring demeanor, which are critical skills of any successful recruiter. She helped coordinate everything for me and answered all of my questions, and I could tell she was an advocate on my behalf with my hiring company. I enjoyed talking with her and, more importantly, trusting her with the process. This has been a big life change for me, but she certainly made it all possible and I am very grateful to have been lucky enough to work with someone very knowledgeable of this process and the real impact it has on her clients. If you are ever in need of finding a qualified candidate or getting connected to a potential new employer, I would highly recommend Nicole.”\n\nGreg Swan\nDirector Of Quality Assurance - OCONUS\nM.C. Dean, Inc.\n{\n\n“I appreciate your TRANSEARCH support in the process. I think you collectively did a great job in taking time to see what I was looking for in my next role, assessing my skill sets and preparing me for interview. I also think you presented my experience well and helped the communication lead to successful outcome for us all.”\n\nGabriel Goffman\nManager\nParagon Energy Capital\n{\n\n“Working with Nicole and the TRANSEARCH team was perfect throughout the interview and evaluation process. They presented me a fantastic opportunity that was well-aligned with my background and strengths. They efficiently gathered the information they needed to present those strengths to their client and actively facilitated the engagement. TRANSEARCH produced results for me, and I’m excited about my new job and the opportunities in front of me!”\n\nScott Stafford\nProgram Manager\nM.C. Dean, Inc.\n{\n\n“My experience with TRANSEARCH was great. There was excellent communication throughout the entire process and I felt well prepared going into the interviews with all of their advice and instructions. Not only were they very professional, but also added a personal touch which I do not typically experience with recruiters. I would definitely use them again.”\n\nQuincy Hilliard\nSenior Manager, Risk Management\nOsaka Gas\n{\n\n“TRANSEARCH International is the best executive search firm in the AEC industry. I have worked with Chris Swan for nearly two decades, first as a candidate, and more recently as a repeat customer. The team is fun to work with, but most important in my view is that they are trustworthy and 100% dependable. When they say they will, they deliver on time.”\n\nDouglas Dayton\nPresident\nAmerican Concrete Pipe Association\n{\n\n“From the first phone call to the one that extended me an offer I was treated like I was the only candidate. Nicole Brown was always upfront with me and very thorough. Being a hiring manager and now a President for an organization, the candidate experience is #1. I couldn’t have asked for a better candidate experience. Nicole’s approach was in which to educate, coach and ask — educate me on the role and expectations — coached me through hurdles and potential barriers — asked me questions every time we were on the phone, because she cared about the process. I would recommend Nicole and the team at TRANSEARCH USA to any company looking to bring on a completely well rounded group that will exceed your expectations from the first phone call.”\n\nKyle Frye\nPresident\nSynthetic MR\nEXPERIENCE THE DIFFERENCE\n\nWe have the world's best industry experts, proprietary innovation, and an unparalleled global network.\n\nSCHEDULE A CONSULTATION\nCOMPANY\nAbout Us\nSolutions\nExpertise\nLocations\nContact\n\nTRANSEARCH International\n\nSOLUTIONS\nExecutive Search\nLeadership Consulting\nInterim Search\nBoard Services\nOpen Opportunities\nRESOURCES\nOrxestra®\nAssessments\nCandidate Charter\nClient Charter\nInsights\nPOLICIES\nPrivacy Policy\nCookies Policy\nAnti-Bribery Policy\nAnti-Slavery Policy\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion\nCopyright © 2025 TRANSEARCH USA.

Yu, Smoov Blends\n\nWe worked with Rootree to produce rebranded pouch packaging for our premium gourmet snacks. Our sales rep Eva Brophy was a pleasure to deal with, and very thorough and responsive to all of our questions throughout the ordering process. We did experience a minor quality issue with our first order, but Eva was able to quickly and professionally resolve. We appreciate the company's great customer service and will definitely be working with them on future projects!\n\nCharlene Li\n\nWe had the pleasure of working with Rootree Packaging this spring on a redesign of our snack pouches. As a young business, we were very appreciative of the patience of and communication with our project manager, Eva Brophy. She was quick to respond when we had any questions and had excellent knowledge of her products. She referred us directly to Kyle McGuire, Manager of Pre-Press Services, when we had to make a last minute change to one of our pouch colours, and he too was outstanding in his attention to detail and timely responses. We chose Rootree initially because they produce in Canada and we value their initiative towards developing sustainable packaging, but we will continue to work with them because of their exemplary customer service. What a team!\n\nSasha Seymour\n\nWe have dealt with Rootree on 3 separate orders within the last few months. Specifically our account manager Kelly Bernier has been nothing short of awesome always quick to reply to questions or concerns and always precise with meeting our deadlines (even those that seemed unreasonable). We also used their design department who were very professional and efficient. I would highly recommend their services to anyone requiring packaging.\n\nCory Smith\n\nRootree did an AMAZING printing job for our company pouches! Laura is a real pleasure to work with. Thank you Laura for being patient with us and so quick to answer all our questions. We are so excited to work with Rootree. Thank you Team Rootree!\n\nNaturally Powerful\n\nOur pouches have been well received and I appreciate your push into compostable materials.\n\nKyle Wilson, Soul Chocolate\n\nWe searched high and low to find a material we were happy with; one that would satisfy consumer expectations without ending up in the environment for thousands of years. That is how we ended up with Rootree, our supplier of compostable packaging!\n\nBen Cullen, Cullen's Food\n\nThank you for the bags. The feedback has been excellent from customers.\n\nAndrew de Jong, TSG\nLatest Blog Posts\nRootree Presents: Osobelle Tea\n\nDec 10, 2024 | Client Features\n\n“We hope to inspire as many people as possible to become avid tea lovers and enjoy more social benefits one cup at a time, bringing ancient traditions to life.”\n\nRead More\nRootree Presents: Beck's Broth\n\nNov 18, 2024 | Client Features\n\nBeck’s Broth is cranking up the heat on bone broth, and the result?

We have many sustainable packaging solutions, including recyclable corrugated and corrugated from recycled content.\n\nWhat industries do your corrugated packaging solutions serve?\n\nOur corrugated shippers are ideal for countless industries, including food/beverage, retail, manufacturing, automotive, pharmaceuticals, and e-commerce.\n\nCan you handle large-volume orders and provide shipping across Canada?\n\nYes, we have extensive manufacturing capabilities to handle orders of any size and supply chain solutions to ship corrugated boxes nationwide across Canada.\n\nHow do you ensure product protection during shipping with corrugated packaging?\n\nThrough customized box design, robust construction, and extensive distribution testing, we engineer corrugated solutions to safely distribute your products.\n\nWhat separates your corrugated shippers from other packaging suppliers?\n\nOur dedicated focus on sustainable innovation, design expertise, nationwide capabilities, and commitment to premium customer service set us apart.\n\nShipmaster containers limited is a full service manufacturer of corrugated paper products and supplier of related packaging to the greater Toronto Area and Southern Ontario\n\nCorrugated Products\nBoard Construction\nFlutes\nFacings and Coatings\nBox Styles\nGlossary of Terms\nImportant Links\nHome\nAbout us\nManagement\nContact Us\nContact Us\n380 Esna Park Drive, Markham, Ontario Canada L3R 1G5\n(416) 493 9193\ninfo@shipmaster.com\n\n© 2025 Shipmaster Containers Ltd.

One that grows good jobs, better health, and well-being, while valuing and protecting nature. It can and must be done in this generation.\n\nWe live in a time of wicked problems: pollution, biodiversity loss, climate change.

We need innovation on all of these fronts, and we need those innovations to support and boost each other, because that’s how we change systems.\n\nDriving innovation on that scale means working with ambitious and committed problem-solvers across sectors and value-chains. Our partners across industry, government, academia, and civil society bring diverse perspectives, experiences, and expertise. They don’t always agree. That’s what real innovation requires. What they share is conviction and a willingness to dig into the tensions and do the hard work. That’s how progress happens.\n\nSolving the plastic waste crisis together\n\nWhat’s the future of plastic packaging?

Highly flexible and capable of adding capacity and supplementing manual labor, collaborative robots with industrial pedigrees, Power and Force Limiting (PFL) technology and intelligent peripherals are bringing highly relevant applications to life.\n\nProduction-Enhancing Motion Control for Robust Robotic Automation\n\nOften struggling to achieve enough flexibility on a single packaging line to accommodate demands, businesses are discovering benefits from incorporating robotic automation with innovative motion control tools, fulfilling end user requirements that may otherwise go unfilled. A key usage that continues to make a difference in material handling and packaging settings is the application of a single programming environment.\n\nYaskawa Solutions for High-Volume Clinical Labs\n\nTo learn how Yaskawa systems for laboratory testing and processing can ensure your clinical lab operations are always moving, attend the ADLM Clinical Lab Expo.
