We’re experts in making your product idea a reality by providing seamless service from product development, design, packaging, and through manufacturing and delivery.\n\nOur highly compliant and nimble facilities continue to expand as well as our diverse range of capabilities, which allows us to create products quickly and efficiently with the expertise you need at the right time.\n\nOur services include:\n\n \n\nDesign and Packaging\n\nDesign\n\nMore than half of purchases are based on emotions. When customers go to a store to purchase a product and have several options in front of them, it’s a battle of perceptions, associations, and brand recognition. Aesthetics can make all the difference, but information is important as well. Giving the customer clear information on the product and making the customer experience great helps build brand credibility. Our in house designers give special attention to both these paradigms to ensure we deliver an outstanding product to the consumer and exceed our client’s expectations.\n\n\nPackaging Solutions\n\n\nDesigning custom packaging for our customers for over 40 years has given us access and unique experience with a variety of packaging solutions. Our product development team works to ensure the best packaging is selected for your brand and artwork is designed with your requested packaging specs in mind. Our team is also committed to building high-quality and cost-efficient solutions to help our customers maximize their bottom line. Your success is our success.\n\nEvery product starts with an idea — your idea. Our skilled and experienced Product development team will work hand in hand with you to create the best possible product while maintaining your ideas and goals.\n\n \n\nResearch & Development\n\nRaw material sourcing\n\nOver the years we have built relationships with our suppliers that excel in Quality, Speed, and Reliability. Whether it’s something as simple as dextrose or pharmaceutical grade vitamins, we will work through our vendors to find the best quality materials for your product.\n\nFormulation\n\nOnce the quality raw materials are sourced, our research and development team will work through the pre-formulating steps to ensure your wants and needs are accurately translated to the new formulation.\n\nPilot runs\n\nDeveloping Pilot runs or prototype batches is often times the most important step. We call upon on our experience most during this phase. Every step that is taken here can reflect later in production. Our Chemists and Formulation R&D team work together to weed out potential pit-falls that may occur when the batch is scaled. Alongside scalability, the efficacy of the product is closely monitored. All these steps help guarantee a successful scale-up.\n\nScale-up to production\n\nMost companies treat only the initial production batches as trials. We strive for perfection during every batch. This means every batch is closely monitored. Even the slightest deviation is documented and reviewed for quality. Efficiency suggestions made during all production runs are also noted and reviewed to provide feedback to our Operation and R&D groups, which may be used to modify future batches and all production batches are recorded in our systems to ensure quality and consistency on future batches. Every part of the production process, from Formulation and Processing, to Filling and Packaging is also reviewed against cGMP practices and Federal regulation to ensure all compliance standards are met or exceeded.\n\n \n\nContract Manufacturing\n\nIn our cGMP & SQF compliant facility, ABS is able to perform flexible production runs, enabling us to get your product to market faster without sacrificing quality. We offer a full range of contract manufacturing services including:\n\nPowder Blending\n\nThis is a popular form for high dosage products such as diet and fiber drinks. We specialize in protein powders, meal replacement drinks, and custom blends. We can provide these products in bulk, or packaged in jars, pouches, or buckets.\n\nTablets\n\nThis industry standard is the most widely used dosage form because of its relatively inexpensive cost. We can manufacture a wide range of sizes and shapes to fit your requirements. Each of our high-speed, high-tonnage presses can produce at speed up to 500,000 tablets per shift which offers quicker turnaround times. We also offer the ability to specialty manufacture large bolus tablets as well as effervescent tablets.\n\nTwo-piece Hard-Shell Gelatin Capsules\n\nA very popular dosage form in the dietary supplement industry. Capsules are easier for consumers to swallow and the capsules shells dissolve quickly for increased absorption. Each of our high-speed encapsulation machines can produce up to 600,000 capsules per shift. Once encapsulated, all capsules are inspected 100% to ensure that only the highest quality product is passed on to our customers.\n\nLiquids (including Gels) – Hot or Cold\n\nOur liquid manufacturing capabilities include anything from 1-2 oz. shooters, to bulk concentrate formulas for large animal applications and everything in between. We also have our own Reverse Osmosis (RODI) water system on site with continuous UV filtration that produces ultra pure water to ensure we provide the highest quality of product.\n\nCreams\n\nCreams are a popular vehicle for products that are related to skin care and anything that might need to require a sensitive application, including cosmetics, bath or shower products, toiletries, and hair care products.\n\nEmulsions\n\nAnytime you have a mixture of two or more liquids that are normally insoluble, you have to use careful and specific methods to get the end product to stabilize. Popular emulsified products include vinaigrettes, condiments, lotions, and detergents or other types of surfactants.\n\nGranulation\n\nAs opposed to free flowing powders, granulating powder helps reduce caking or clumping as well as reduce dust when distributing the product, especially in agriculture applications. It is also a popular method for sensitive time release products that require specific granule density and size.\n\nCUSTOMER JOURNEYS\n\nWe’re here to help our clients achieve their product goals and make them successful for the long-haul.\n\nWe've worked with ABS for 30 years and have enjoyed a truly collaborative partnership.  Everyone at ABS is professional, knowledgeable and responsive. David Wood has helped to take our product ideas and goals and created products that we are extremely proud of and that sell very well. He's helped develop entirely new products, provides countless suggestions for improvements and keeps us aware of new directions in our market. We started as a small, brand new business and have  continued to grow over the years - even during tough economic times.  We've never felt the need to look for or work with another manufacturer, because if we've ever had an issue ABS, has made it right for us.  We feel a level of trust and loyalty that is a rare thing in the industry. We look forward to many more years working together.\n\n30+ year customer, Foot-care and Spa products\nIn one word, ABS Corporation is reliable. Having done business with numerous contract manufacturers over the past 30+ years, ABS stands alone in their level of reliability, responsiveness, and compliance.

If the nutrient isn’t in nanosuspension, the result is that most of the ingested nutrient passes through your body, never to be absorbed. Nano supplements have near-instant absorption. In fact, most of the serving size is absorbed before it reaches the digestive system.\n\nLearn More\n\nCustomized Manufacturing Solutions\nPrivate label Supplements & Vitamins\n\nYour health and wellness business is unique – shouldn’t your private label nutraceuticals be too? Nano9 boasts a team of skilled formulators, flavorists, and manufacturing experts dedicated to ensuring high-quality, custom-formulated nutraceuticals for your brand.\n\nWe provide custom nanotechnology nutraceutical manufacturing services for liquid dietary supplements.

Allowing us to provide extensive ingredient availability to support niche and mainstream formulations.\nApply our in-house proprietary herbal extraction and cutting-edge nutraceutical preparation methods. Giving us the ability to handle orders big and small, with short lead times and unbeatable prices.\nUp to the minute and deep understanding of constantly changing amazon requirements. Including: compliance, documentation, and FBA prep.\nIn house fulfillment: connect your Shopify, Walmart, eBay etc... accounts and we'll fulfill them for you, with your inserts.\nWhether it’s matching an already successful product or adding to your line - the Triton team makes your vision a reality with excellent communication the whole way.\nThe Keys to Trusting Your Manufacturer:\nWhy Choose Triton?\n▼ Competitors ▼\nYou overpay\n\nContract manufacturers are notoriously known for price-gouging, and having exorbitant bottle minimums that the average company just cannot meet.\n\nThe lead times you’re quoted come and go!\n\nYou Order Your Product from a Distributor or an impersonal contract manufacturer: This way you end up with either a stock formulation that doesn't stand out or you wait around for months (even a year) with little communication before your custom formula is finally finished.\n\nYou get a product that doesn’t match what you want or are currently selling:\n\nYour manufacturer is simply stumped on how to produce what you want. This means he can’t match your current product, or realize your vision for a new formula.\n\nYou run out of stock because of poor management and inconsistent lead times\n\nThey’ll promise you one date, then say they are backlogged or can’t find a certain ingredient, and your frustrated customers are left wondering when it'll be back in stock!\n\nYour manufacturer can’t help you with your documentation requirements:\n\nThese days a brand needs to be able to provide exactly the right documentation and maintain strict compliance standards. If your manufacturer can’t keep up with you it’s possible that you could lose your ability to sell on certain marketplaces or worse!\n\n▼ Triton ▼\nYou get extremely competitive and transparent pricing\n\nWe have unique partnerships with ingredient suppliers to get you the best price possible. You also won’t find any hidden fees, or bait and switch tactics. The price you’re quoted is the price you pay!\n\nProven Experts\n\nWe give you an end-to-end picture of what’s happening with your project. You will be notified and kept in the loop about any significant changes or delays in your formulation or manufacturing process so that you can make informed decisions.\n\nCustomized Solutions\n\nWe take a flexible approach with our clients because each one has unique needs. Whether you need help with matching an existing product or with custom formulation, we are here for you every step of the way!\n\nFull communication and transparency every step of the way\n\nWe work with you to create a fully custom formula with the ingredients you choose. We have experience working with a huge number of herbs and plants. Whether you are trying to match an existing hot selling formula or start from scratch, we know what to do!\n\nAll of the following are available (and more):\nHow Does Ordering with Us Work?\n3 Simple Steps Take Your Inspiration to A Finished Product.\n\nWe know that no two businesses are the same. Keeping that in mind, we’ve helped businesses scale from garage sized to multi-location success stories. Whether your initial order is large or small, we will ensure that you have the highest quality formula, fastest turn around times, and the most competitive margins so you can GROW!\n\nStep 1: Get a Call or Email Within 24 Hours to Discuss Your Project Details\n\nNo two businesses are the same. We’ve helped businesses scale from 1-room offices into 50,000 square-foot success stories. Whether your orders are large or small, we’ll ensure you have the most competitive margins for optimal growth.\n\nStep 2: Our Natural Health Experts & Ingredient Profilers Craft You the Best Formula with the Most Compelling Offer\n\nAlready have a formula in mind?

We’ve made a complicated subject like nutrition simple and easy to communicate to your customers. These ingredient profiles are filled with everything you need to create the most compelling, persuasive offers imaginable.\n\nStep 3: Your Formula is Carefully Prepared in Our Brand New cGMP compliant & FDA Registered Facility\n\nMost liquid supplement manufacturers use a hot alcohol-extraction method that can damage ingredients, render them ineffective, and even ‘spoil’ the formula faster. We extract our formulas within an alcohol-free, target-temperate-controlled aqueous extraction medium with glycerol so you get the most out of every ingredient and ensure your formula is preserved for a long time.\n\nRest assured, we test every formula for purity and have stringent in-house quality assurance testing. Your product is tested for potency and quality by a 3rd party before we ship it to you.\n\nSupplement Manufacturing Learning Center:\nHerbal Manufacturers: Your Key Partner for Quality Supplement Production\nHow Private Label Tinctures Can Boost Your Brand and Meet Market Demand\nLiquid Tincture Supplements: Choosing the Right Manufacturer\nSupplement Contract Manufacturers: Finding Your Perfect Partner\nCraft Your Own Supplement Brand: A Detailed Step-by-Step Guide\nLiquid Vitamins: A Game-Changer in Health and Wellness\nLiquid Supplements 101: Everything You Need to Know\nUnlocking the World of Nutraceuticals: From Manufacturing to Private Label Success\nThe Ultimate Guide to Choosing a Liquid Supplement Manufacturer\nLiquid Dietary Supplements: Locating a Manufacturer for All Ingredient Types\nFinding a Reputable Supplement Manufacturer: Key Considerations for Your Business\nPrivate Label Liquid Supplements: A Comprehensive Guide for Starting Your Own Brand\nFrom Concept to Creation: Starting Your Own Custom Liquid Supplement Brand\nWhite Label Liquid Supplements: Your Guide to Cost-Effective Branding\nWholesale Liquid Supplements: Offering a Natural Approach to Wellness\nChoosing the Right Liquid Supplement Supplier: A Roadmap for Success\nPrivate Label Liquid Vitamins: Finding a Manufacturer for Entrepreneurial Success\nLiquid Supplement Manufacturing: Choosing the Right Partner for Your Brand\nQuality Control Guarantee\n\nOur cutting-edge nutraceutical manufacturing machinery, cGMP & FDA certified lab, and in-house quality control department carefully monitor your liquid supplement to ensure it meets industry standards and passes all third-party testing - guaranteed.

I was only in the store for a couple minutes, but I did open one of the boxes and looked at the finished product. The bottle looks great, and I was happy with the seal and the stamp on the bottom of the bottle. We will definitely contact you for the next encapsulation.

The company had put processes in place around communication to make improvements in these areas, but Flynn realized they needed a more formal process that would bridge the gap between the support teams, leadership, and the shop floor. \nWorking with Elliot Price, Augusta region manager for the Georgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership (GaMEP) at Georgia Tech, Nutritional Resources was enrolled as a candidate for the no-cost energy and sustainability assessment, provided by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Industrial Assessment Center (IAC) and conducted by GaMEP. The GaMEP team, including students and co-ops, came to the plant to identify areas of excess energy spend and make recommendations for cost-savings improvements. The team made a number of recommendations and thus far, after implementing just two of the suggestions, the company has realized a cost savings of more than $35,000 per year.\n\nRead all about it here >>\n\nWHAT OUR CLIENTS ARE SAYING\n\nAssociating with HealthWise was one of the best business decisions that I have ever made!

Our Health Sciences team employs a multi-disciplinary approach of applied natural sciences, engineering and technology to our domain, Nutrition, which is the science that interprets the interaction of nutrients and other substances in food in relation to maintenance, growth, reproduction, health and disease in human beings. It includes absorption, assimilation, catabolism, biosynthesis, and excretion.\n\nPNHS is particularly concerned with Under-nutrition, or Inadequate Nutrition, a form of malnutrition resulting from lack of the necessary foods or failure of the body to absorb or assimilate nutrients properly, and Metabolic Syndrome, defined as the presence of at least three of the five following medical conditions: abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high serum triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. PNHS is also a leader in the field of research and development of nutriceuticals that contribute and otherwise support optimal physical performance, sometimes referred to as Sports Performance, Anti-Aging and Immune Response.\n\n \n\nFeatured Products\n\nWith the COVID-19 global pandemic affecting everyone in some way for months to come, we are all wondering what we can do to stay healthy. Nutrition is a critical determinant of immune responses and malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency worldwide. Deficiency of single nutrients also results in altered immune responses: this is observed even when the deficiency state is relatively mild.

We faced many challenges along the way, including finding a great manufacturing partner, getting samples, and doing multiple rounds of revisions. Jake was incredibly patient and kind throughout the process, even when I was feeling frustrated or discouraged we weren't going to get it done. He was always willing to listen to my ideas and offer constructive feedback. He also helped me vet potential manufacturing partners and negotiate reasonable costs for samples. I learned a ton about the science of probiotics and how to create a product that is both effective and safe.\n\n-Chris L. \n\nFounder & CEO at autobrush, a Basis company.\n\nJake helped with manufacturing overflow that a client had that required a quick turn around. \n\nHe was very responsive & was able to hit the deadlines.

Using freeze-drying (lyophilization) food producers can achieve exceptional nutrient preservation, economical, lightweight packaging suitable for long-term storage. Freeze-Drying (lyophilization) for Exceptional Nutrient Preservation, Smart Packaging and Long-Term Storage Preserve Nutrients In the world of food preservation, freeze-drying (lyophilization) is a remarkable process for retaining the nutritional value and flavors of many types of food products. If you are a food producer who is looking for an effective way to package your product and ensure optimal nutrient preservation, you can now rely on Gembra Health to provide these benefits by using their freeze-drying process for your product. Retain Aesthetic Appeal Freeze-drying preserves much of the original colors and shapes of the raw material, resulting in aesthetically pleasing, aromatic, appetizing foods. The intense flavor and aroma of freeze-dried ingredients also closely resembles the profile of the raw material, which reassures your consumers they are actually getting real fruits and vegetables in their diets. Smart Packaging and Storage The freeze-drying process results in space-saving lightweight packaging which saves on storage space and shipping costs. For the end-consumer, freeze-dried foods are highly desirable as they only need to rehydrate desired serving portions, thereby reducing waste. Understanding Freeze Drying (Lyophilization) Freeze drying, also known as lyophilization, is a specialized preservation method that removes moisture from food products while maintaining their original structure and nutritional content. This process is composed of three primary phases: freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying. Let us explore the freeze-drying (lyophilization) process and how Gembra excels in helping you achieve exceptional nutrient preservation. Freezing: This first step subjects the food product to extremely low temperatures, typically around -40°C to -50°C. This freezing phase solidifies the water content within the food, converting it into ice. Primary Drying: Next, the frozen food is placed in a vacuum chamber. In this controlled environment, the pressure is lowered while slightly increasing the temperature. This change in pressure and temperature induces a process known as sublimation, where the ice transitions directly from a solid to a gas without passing through the liquid phase. As a result, the water content is removed from the food, leaving behind a porous structure. Secondary Drying: During this final stage, any remaining moisture is removed from the food, ensuring that it reaches a moisture level that is safe for long-term storage. Why Choose Gembra Health as a Freeze-Drying Partner: Cutting-Edge Technology: We have invested in state-of-the-art freeze-drying equipment that allows for precise control over temperature and pressure conditions. This ensures that the food products are processed optimally, preserving their nutritional integrity. Customized Solutions: Gembra Health understands that every food product is unique, and the freeze-drying process must be tailored accordingly. Our experts will work closely with you to meet your specific needs, production schedules and ultimately achieve the highest quality finished product. Stringent Quality Control: Nutrient preservation is our top priority. We maintain rigorous quality control measures throughout the freeze-drying process to ensure that the final product retains the highest nutritional value and freshest taste. Competitively Priced Services: We strive to provide excellent value for our freeze-drying services without compromising on quality. Gembra Health will help you deliver food products with exceptional nutrient preservation, smart, space-saving packaging and premium presentation. Make the smart choice and partner with us to elevate the quality and longevity of your food products in the market.\nCONTACT US NOW \n\nOffering:\nbovine collagen powder\n\nbovine glandulars\n\nbovine kidney\n\nbovine thyroid new zealand\n\ndesiccated bovine thyroid supplements\n\nwholesale bovine glandulars\n\npremium bovine collagen powder\n\nbulk new zealand bovine liver\n\nbovine collagen supplements\n\nbovine collagen supplements supplier\n\nbulk collagen\n\nbulk bovine glandulars\n\nthyroid natural glandular\n\nliver glandular\n\nhydrolyzed bovine\n\ngrass fed bovine collagen\n\nfreeze dried liver\n\nnatural desiccated thyroid new zealand\n\n\ncommercial freeze drying services\n\nsublimation freeze drying\n\nfreeze drying services\n\nfreeze drying process\n\nlyophilization process\n\nfreeze drying companies\n\nfreeze drying solutions\n\n\n\n\nMENU\nHome\nProducts\nFreeze Drying\nContact Us\n\nBlog\n\n©Gembra Health 2023\n\nAll rights reserved\n\nGET IN TOUCH\nPHONE: (518) 672-1506\n\n\nMAIL: PO BOX 280\nPhilmont, NY 12565-0280\n\n\nWAREHOUSE:\n164 Main St \nPhilmont NY 12565\n\n\n   \n \nShare by:"

Quality Ingredients (QIC) is one of many companies that provide contract spray drying services, turning liquid into powder, but that is where the similarity ends. \n\nWhy QIC?\nContact Us\nIt’s All About the Manufacturing Advantage We Provide to You.\n\nWe don’t measure success by the number of pounds we produce, the rate of utilization of our equipment, or the number of orders or transactions we process. It is about the manufacturing advantage we build with you, for you.\n\nWhen does building a manufacturing advantage matter? \n\nIf your powder requirements are not standard or straight forward, or if your business has unique requirements for success, those requirements can create some worries in finding the right, best fit, contract spray drying provider. \n\nWe excel in turning manufacturing worries into manufacturing advantages. We do that by listening and working together to build a manufacturing process (from raw material acquisition to invoicing) customized to your needs. Done right, QIC becomes a seamless extension of your company. \n\nIf you are looking for a lot more than just powder – if you need a rock solid, long-term partnership focused on giving you a manufacturing advantage, you have come to the right place. \n\nContact Us\nClient Success\n\nChallenge: A large West Coast food and beverage manufacturer recognized that having a key ingredient in powder form would speed up its finished good manufacturing process. Its leaders sought a contract spray drying provider that could turn this expensive raw ingredient into a powder, taking the care to get it done right. The service provider had to be able to accommodate the customer’s exacting specifications with regard to particle size, color, odor, taste, moisture, and yield.\n\nSolution: We were able to handle the customer’s raw ingredient with the care it required, as well as follow the very complex process protocol needed to spray dry their product. Our Operations team, QIC closely monitored the manufacturing process for temperature, filtering, moisture control, and other parameters. Along the way, quality control checkpoints were incorporated to provide added assurance of an exceptional end product.\n\nResults: QIC managed to successfully spray-dry the raw ingredient according to the customer’s stringent expectations while keeping the project within the desired budget. Ultimately, this helped the manufacturer execute an integral production step they were not able to complete internally. With their ingredient in a high-quality powdered form, the customer is now able to save time and money in manufacturing and secure a competitive edge in a dynamic marketplace.\n\nCorporate Office\n\nQuality Ingredients Corporation\n14300 Rosemount Drive\nBurnsville, MN 55306\nPh: 952-898-4002 | Fax: 952-898-4421\n\nAbout QIC\n\nSnapshot Today\n\nCore Values\n\nContact Us\n\nQIC Capabilities\n\nOverview\n\nCustom Spray Drying\n\nQIC Branded Products\n\nWorking with Different Customer Starting Points\n\nWhy Choose QIC\n\nQIC’s Position in the Market\n\n© 2024 Copyright Quality Ingredients Corporation."

Lactic acid is one of our essential body requirements, but how to get it right away? No worries! Bacillus Coagulans Probiotics have resolved this crucial problem. It’s different from Lactobacillus; therefore, don’t mix it with this compound.\n\nBacillus Coagulans is also known as Weizmannia Coagulans. They are some sort of good bacteria to form lactic acid other than Lactobacillus. These species were first discovered and addressed by B.W. Most importantly, they are not naturally available in the human body and produce the required lactic acid in the stomach; that’s a big plus.\n\nBacillus Coagulans are very helpful probiotics, and the main reason for the focus is their ability to survive in extreme environments.

Soft gelatin capsules are easy to swallow, disintegrate quickly, and can significantly improve the bioavailability of active ingredients. Softgel capsules can be adapted for many specialized uses. Consumers can see that soft gels are hermetically sealed, which not only protects the active ingredients in the fill material from oxidation, moisture, and microbial contamination, but also are tamper-proof. Problems with the one-piece softgels would be indicated through leakage or discoloration. This dosage form is precise and uniform, providing greater stability, purity, and consistency of the nutrients encapsulated.\n\nAnother key strength of using softgels is their versatility. There are wide varieties of shell colors, shapes, and sizes available to offer product differentiation in the market. Although aesthetically-pleasing supplements appeal to the consumer’s eye, the inner fill of the capsule is even more important. Softgel capsules can accommodate a wide variety of compounds filled as a semi-solid, liquid, gel, or paste. Also, more emulsion and micro-encapsulated materials are being put into softgel capsules, making them more functional and giving a greater variety of choices as to availability and dosing.\n\nPurpose-Driven Products\n\nWe strive to be good corporate citizens, which includes considering the environmental impact of our operations and balancing the needs of our business with those of the community.\n\nBy adopting a strategy of lean manufacturing and green thinking, we have streamlined our production process and are utilizing our resources more efficiently.

Easy to call ahead for refills.Parking is small but always a spot available.

The cost was significantly less at Shertech than what we paid at either of two other compounding pharmacies we'd used before moving here. AND, when my son didn't like the taste of the first bottle of medicine, they asked us to bring it back and swapped it out that same day *at no cost* for a new one they'd made up using a different base and flavoring. He liked the second version just fine and has been happily taking it twice a day. Wonderful!

        "textData": "Skip to content\nAPS BIO GROUP\nHome\nWHY IS COLOSTRUM IMPORTANT FOR NEWBORNS\n\nWhile starting to feed the babies, colostrum will be the first milk produced by the mammary glands. It is the ideal nourishment any newborn can ever get. It is densely concentrated, full of proteins and nutrients. So a little dose of colostrum can provide lots of health benefits for a newborn. Colostrum also has a low-fat content and is easy to digest. It has all the components to give a healthy start to a newborn. One of the most notable factors is that colostrum helps in building the immune system of the baby. The healthcare sector is exploring cryptocurrencies for secure, efficient transactions and data management. Innovative projects, such as the $MIND crypto presale, aim to revolutionize funding for medical research and patient care. By integrating blockchain, healthcare systems can enhance transparency, reduce costs, and improve accessibility to critical services globally.\n\nFIGHTS INFECTIONS\n\nMost parts of the colostrum are filled with white blood cells that protect from infections that help the baby fight against such bacterial or viral infections all by himself. White blood cells are very important for the immune system. They offer protection and fight pathogens. As the baby is newly introduced to the world, he must be ready to face the challenges that may infect him. Challenges are part of every industry. Gamers face various challenges in online games, including connectivity issues, in-game competition, and security concerns. For those exploring online gambling, ensuring a secure experience is vital. Casinos in der Schweiz legal offer trusted platforms, but players must navigate regulations and responsible gaming practices to enjoy a safe and enjoyable gaming environment.\n\nThe antibodies produced by the white blood cells in the colostrum neutralized viruses and bacteria. They are an ideal solution for diarrhea and tummy issues. It will be very useful for newborns with immature guts.\n\nHELPS IN GUT FUNCTIONS AND IMPROVES IMMUNITY\n\nsIgA, which is a very important antibody, is present in colostrum. It helps to protect newborn babies from various diseases. Molecules that have been helping the mother to protect against various infections through the immune system will be transported to the breast through her blood. It joins to form sIgA and will be secreted through colostrum. It will be concentrated in the baby’s gut’s mucus lining as well as the respiratory system. It protects the baby from diseases already faced by the mother.\n\nColostrum also has many growth factors and immunologic elements that promote the growth of some protective mucus membranes in the intestines of the baby. It will also help in the growth of good bacteria in the gut of the baby.\n\nPREVENTS JAUNDICE\n\nAlong with saving from tummy upsets, a baby can benefit more from colostrum. It serves as a laxative that helps newborns to poop consistently. Thus, the baby can get rid of everything he had in his tummy while in the womb. It will be released as meconium, which is a sticky and dark stool.\n\nWhen the baby poops regularly, he will be safe from the chances of jaundice. During the birth of a baby, he will have high red blood cell levels, taking all the oxygen present around the baby’s body. When such a cell breaks, the liver will process them, producing bilirubin. If the liver of the baby isn’t completely developed to process this bilirubin, it gets built up in the baby’s system, which results in jaundice. Colostrum has laxative properties that help to poop out the bilirubin in the baby’s body.\n\nMINERALS AND VITAMINS\n\nColostrum has Vitamin A and carotenoids that give it a yellow color. It also helps to improve the vision of the baby and provides good health to his immune system and skin.\n\nSearch\nSearch\nRECENT POSTS\nWhat Is The Difference Between Colostrum And Breast Milk\nWhat Are The Health Benefits Of Colostrum\nWhy Is Colostrum Important For Newborns\n\n© 2025 APS Bio Group | WordPress Theme: Blog Bank by wp theme space."

Neova takes an integrated approach to product development and quality enhancement. With a strong history in research and development to support the products we sell, our approach is to seek practical solutions that regularly challenge current limits and assumptions. Neova’s strong team of researchers understands the functionality that our products can bring to the different industries and applications that our customers represent. Some research projects are undertaken with the objective of publication for the benefit of the industry, while others are carried out for the benefit of a single customer. Regardless, the same systematic approach to the research applies. In addition, our customers are critical in establishing market needs and identifying opportunities. We collaborate and work with our customers to identify new products and applications. Our operations and production group is a third critical partner in research and product development. This group is involved throughout the product design and improvement process, ensuring that the product the customer needs can be delivered consistently and meets the specifications the customer requires. The results: Neova delivers solutions that are custom-designed to meet the needs of our customers. A rigorous approach to research and a strong quality-centered operational environment ensures that quality is not compromised for speed or expense.\n\nNeova Technologies Inc. is a Bioseutica Group company.\n\n\nThe production facilities are located in Abbotsford, BC, Canada. The equipment is strategically placed at processing facilities to guarantee continuous access to fresh, traceable raw materials and to enhance logistics and cost savings. The production process follows GMP guidelines. Neova Technologies Inc. holds GMP certification for the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients as well as Halal and Kosher certifications for compliant food solutions. Functional food ingredients and diagnostic media can be used for cell and tissue culture or to develop nutraceutical products and infant formulas.\n\nNatural ingredients\nNatural source Functional Food Ingredients, API and Research Media\nPancreatic Enzymes\n\nPancreatic enzymes are naturally occurring proteins that play an important role in the digestion of food. They hydrolyze various proteins and lipids using the same natural process as the human digestive system. Trypsin and chymotrypsin are classified as serine proteases with specific cleaving characteristics. Trypsin preferentially hydrolyzes bonds whose carboxyl groups are contributed by lysine (Lys) or arginine (Arg). Chymotrypsin hydrolyzes peptide bonds involving phenylalanine (Phe), tyrosine (Tyr), and tryptophan (Trp).  Phospholipase (PA2) is a standardized product that cleaves the fatty acid in the second position in phospholipids. These pancreatic enzymes hydrolyze various proteins and lipids using the same natural process as the human digestive system. Neova’s experienced technical and processing advisors work with customers, developing blends and formulating products to suit specific needs. The applications list below serves as a starting point. Except for Phospholipase A2, all pancreatic enzymes are lyophilized (freeze-dried), resulting in enhanced solubility and minimal dust.\n\nEgg Proteins\n\nNaturally occurring egg-white proteins are extracted and purified from the hen egg, where they prevent bacterial growth, bind metal ions and vitamins, and act as a nutrient source for the developing chicken embryo. For many industries, Neova uses proprietary extraction and purification processes to produce egg-white proteins. Avidin is used in immunodiagnostics because of its strong affinity for biotin (vitamin H). In many applications, ovalbumin may be a very effective and preferable choice over Bovine Serum Albumin. Likewise, ovotransferrin is very similar to both human and bovine-derived transferring, including lactoferrin, and can be substituted in many instances. Ovomucoid is a natural trypsin inhibitor. As such, it is commonly used as a replacement for serum trypsin inhibitors in tissue culture research.\n\nFOLLOW US\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBioseutica\nThe Group\nProducts\nR&D Vision\nEU Data Protection\nTerms and Conditions\nInfo\nContact us\nCareers\nCertifications\nCustomer & Supplier\nGET UPDATES\n \n\n \n\nCopyright © 2025 Bioseutica® - All rights reserved.\n\n \n\nBioseutica BV - Landbouwweg 83 3899 BD - Zeewolde - The Netherlands\nPhone: +31.36.522.6300 @: Customer Services\n\nUse of this website signifies your agreement to the Privacy Policy and Cookies terms\n\nThis content is intended solely for B2B operators - Regulatory Status can vary between Countries: contact us for further details | Login\n\n22"

Liquid emulsions are most commonly used to fortify milk, dairy & non-dairy foods, beverages, dietary supplements and other liquid applications.\n\nOil Blends\n\nFormulations of oil-soluble nutrients are manufactured into ready-to-use concentrations for dietary supplement liquid capsules as well as the fortification of food fats and oils.\n\nSoluble Powders\n\nOil-soluble nutrients are emulsified with excipients, then dried into a water-dispersible powder. Soluble powders are ideal for fortifying foods, beverages, capsules and tablets.\n\nAbsorbate Powders\n\nFormulations of oil-soluble nutrients are adsorbed on a carrier to create adsorbate powders. These concentrated powders are ideal for fortifying dietary supplements and foods where high concentration or low inclusion are important and where water solubility is not a concern.\n\nOur mission is to be a preeminent global manufacturer and supplier of vitamins for human and animal nutrition while delivering superior customer service.

        "textData": "Request More Info\nPRIVATE AND WHITE LABEL CBD\n\nWelcome to the official website of MaxVera Wellness. We aim to be your one-stop-shop for the best white label CBD and other high-quality nano supplements. Our team has spent years perfecting formulations through our proprietary nano emulsification process to give you the highest quality product line available. And did you know that most of the CBD on the market is only 18% bioavailable at best?  Even when multiple CBD companies claim this or that, the truth is that the life-changing compounds from the hemp plant have limited absorption. That’s where we come in. Developed by our chief in-house scientist and other nanoscientists at MIT, we have solved the poor solubility issue by creating our own proprietary nano process. Our white label water-soluble CBD products have some of the highest shelf life of any other competitor and are manufactured at our nano facility in American Fork, Utah USA.\n\nAfter years of supplying other manufacturers and companies with high-quality supplements and private label CBD products, we have decided to offer our product line to the small business sector. Now by having direct access to us, you can save time and money by cutting out the middle man and getting your wholesale CBD right from the manufacturer. Not only do you get your water soluble nano CBD straight from our lab, but you also get some of the top scientists in the world perfecting your formulations and processes, always putting out better products with high efficacy. We also include a third-party Certificate of Analysis with every order to make sure you and your customers get what they pay for. Now your company can offer quality hemp products from one of the best white label CBD manufacturers in the United States. Reach out to MaxVera today, and a dedicated American team member will walk you through this simple process from start to finish.\n\nPrivate Label CBD\nAre you looking for quality private label CBD solution for your company or brand. At MaxVera, we can have your labels printed in house for smaller orders, and for larger orders, we will walk you through our simple process from start to finish.\nLearn About Private Labeling\n\nWhite Label CBD\nOne of the best ways to get in the game is through our white label CBD program. With super low MOQ’s, some of the highest grade CBD products on the market, and very competitive pricing, we can’t wait to help get your CBD business up and running.\nLearn More About White Labeling\n\nSpecial Formulations\nWe are an FDA registered lab that has been making special formulations for years for some of the biggest brands in the supplement and health industry. With certain MOQ’s we can create some of the most unique health products.\nContact Us For Special Formulations\nNow Offering Drop Shipping To Your Customers\n\nLocated In The Midwest For Fast Delivery\n\nVirtual Integration Through Shipstation\n\nDiscounted Shipping Cost\n\nTalk To a MaxVera Representative Today\nOver 3 Billion Dollars Of Private\nLabel Products Sold\n\nUnlike many of the fly by night private label manufacturers that are here today and gone tomorrow, our team at MaxVera has been in this business for going on three decades. We have had the privilege of working with some of the top brands in the world and have sold over 3 billion dollars worth of private label supplements. Our products have graced the shelves of Costco, Walmart, and GNC, along with many other retail locations. When you partner with MaxVera as your private label CBD manufacturer, you are partnering with the pros.\n\n \n\nReady To Build Your Brand With A Private Label?\nLearn More About Private Labeling\n✓ LEADERS IN NANOTECHNOLOGY\nOur scientists have formulated over 1000 different products in the supplement field. We hold multiple patents and are currently making products for some of the biggest names in the industry.\nWe are constantly in the laboratory, perfecting our formulations while looking for new and better applications and delivery systems. Whenever we release these products, you will have a first-mover advantage to market these products to your customers. Our scientists are who make us one of the best white label CBD companies in the world.\n✓ THE BEST PRICING IN CBD\nWe are now offering some of the best pricing in the wholesale, private label, white label, and supplement industry. We will do what we can to meet or beat anybody else's pricing with a low MOQ.\nIt is very important that when you do compare different companies' pricing, that you are comparing apples to apples. Our nano CBD is either a full spectrum or broad spectrum formulation. Much of the water soluble nano CBD on the market is merely just Isolate. Make sure to not fall for that trick when choosing your supplier and looking at the price.\nMAX ABSORPTION\nMAX PROFITS\nCBD Made With Care And Precision\n\nAt MaxVera we do everything within our means to provide our clients with the best white label CBD products on the market for the best price possible. We are not just looking for a quick sale but rather long term strategic partners that want to sculpt the CBD landscape together. Our Water Soluble and Oil-Based CBD products are some of the best priced in the industry and are confident that we can offer the best value not just on price but quality as well.

These readily available products, combined with our suggested containers and label templates, make it incredibly easy to produce a fully customized and branded product with minimal time and effort. By leveraging our reliable and pre-developed formulations, you can swiftly bring your product to life without compromising on quality or brand identity.\n\nChoose from existing formulas\nLowest cost\nFastest turnaround\nMODIFIED FORMULA\n\nOur modified formulation path offers flexibility for making slight adjustments to our standard formulations. Typically, we allow for up to 2 ingredient changes, catering to companies that appreciate the qualities of a standard formulation but require specific customizations such as a unique flavor, the addition of essential oils, or other ingredients that align with their brand or message. While semi-custom formulations may take slightly longer than standard formulations, our streamlined process ensures minimal research and development iterations, allowing for a relatively quick turnaround time. This option is ideal for businesses seeking a balance between customization and efficiency.\n\nMaking minimum changes to existing formulas\nAllows for custom ingredients, scents and flavors\nQuicker than Full-Custom\nCUSTOM FORMULATION\n\nFull-custom formulation offers you the ability to create a one-of-a-kind product that aligns with your brand vision and message. Our team will collaborate with you to develop a formulation that satisfies your precise requirements, either based on your guidance or entirely from scratch. This option involves the most extensive process and can vary significantly in terms of timeline and formulation costs, dependent on the degree of customization requested. However, it is the ideal option for those seeking a completely unique product that embodies their brand message and vision.\n\nCreate a unique formulation\nMultiple iterations\nTestimonials\n\n\"I’ve had the opportunity to work with Tate and the rest of the team at Elite Health Partners on several large projects and I am always impressed with the quality of product, the timeliness of correspondence, and extremely competitive pricing.

Being a top exporter of organic products, highest quality at reasonable rates is one and only priority of us.\n\nOrganic Farming in India has played a major role in changing the landscape of Agricultural Practices in our country. Earlier, due to the rise in the population, the main focus of agricultural sector shifted to increasing the output in order to provide the necessary supply for the given demand and minimize the import of health products and agricultural goods. But this has lead to rise in the adulteration practices in the country such as excessive use of pesticides, fertilizers and other toxins in the cultivation of crops in order to get high yield at minimum time, which has caused contamination of water resources and soil, health problems and deficiencies in humans because of poor nutrition value of the products.\n\n\nThe aggressive agricultural techniques also lead to inferior working conditions for the farm labors, rise in production costs, and eventually, decentralization of economic and social conditions in rural areas. Organic Farming has been in India for thousands of years, but as the need of sustainable agricultural arise in the last few decades, farmers, producers and policy makers shifted their focus to the Organic Farming practices. Various research and developments have lead to effective and efficient use of resources in order to get high output without the use of toxic chemicals, and Organic Farming has provided new market to the small rural farmers in which they can directly deal with the customers and promote fair prices and fair market practices.\n\nProduct Category\nOrganic Botanical Extract\nOrganic Cereals\nOrganic Edible Oils\nOrganic Emulsifiers\nOrganic Essentials Oils & Extracts\nOrganic Fatty Acids\nOrganic Flours\nOrganic Formulations\nOrganic Herbs\nOrganic Minerals\nOrganic Nutraceuticals\nOrganic Nuts\nOrganic Oil Seeds\nOrganic Pulses\nOrganic Special Products\nOrganic Spices\nOrganic Starch\nOrganic Vitamins\nFollow our Blog\nBENEFITS OF ORGANIC FOOD\nTRENDS IN CONSUMPTION OF ORGANIC FOOD\nORGANIC AND YOUR HEALTH\nBENEFITS AND USES OF CASTOR OIL\nSitemap\nHome\nAbout us\nOur Products\nBlog\nResources\nDownloads\nContact us\nGoogle Map\nQuery Form\n\nContacts\nmarketing@aryanint.com\n+91-97170 27770\nF-58, Radhe Mohan Drive, Jonapur, New Delhi - 110 047 (India)\n15407, Crystal Springs Way, Louisville, Kentucky 40245 USA\n\n© Copyright 2024.

Our hallmark is the development, marketing, and sale of innovative, targeted products that adhere to traditional Swiss-quality standards. CEDEM’s vision is to be “The trusted partner” in the well-being of every family member.\n\nOur product range addresses the fundamental health needs of women, men, and children, complemented by unique formulations designed for better aging, longevity, and enhanced body performance.\n\nFounded in 1991 by Dr. Martin Schmid, CEDEM AG began with the creation of groundbreaking, high-quality vitamins. In 2016, after extensive experience in the pharmaceutical industry,  Miss Rasha Oudeh bought the company and assumed leadership to realize her vision of developing pioneering premium vitamin products that would line the shelves of every pharmacy and other outlets worldwide, promoting healthier, happier, and longer lives.\n\nToday, CEDEM AG, headquartered in Zurich, has grown into a multinational company with offices in Frankfurt, New York, Amman, and Lagos. We offer a diverse portfolio of over 60 specialized products for the entire family, reaching export sales in more than 25 countries across Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia through a B2B business model. We also operate on a B2C model, leveraging platforms like Amazon and other online retail channels.\n\nREAD MORE\nOur Products\nCLOSE\nCOLLAGEN: Joints\n\nPromotes healthy and flexible joints.\n\nCLOSE\nDEFENSES PROBIOTIC\n\nMaintains intestinal health and boosts immune system.\n\nCLOSE\nMYVER\n\nEnhance men’s fertility.\n\nCLOSE\nBRAINOMAX\n\nContributes to normal mental performance.\n\nCLOSE\nMYOFOL\n\nContributes to improved fertility, conception, and overall reproductive health.\n\nMORE\nSwiss Vitality\nfor women, men, and longevity\n\nRooted in the Swiss tradition of vitality and longevity, we believe that every family member should always be a priority. Our approach is to stay connected to people, listen to their needs, and create what they truly desire.\n\nIn response to the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have recognized the importance of reinforcing our market presence and enhancing our brand identity. As part of these efforts, we have restructured our product offerings into four distinct lines, each focusing on specific health needs and overall well-being for women, men, and  longevity.\n\nIn addition to these specialized lines, CEDEM continues to offer a range of products that support essential vitamins and lifestyle improvements for both children and adults.\n\nWomen Owned Business\nfrom Zero to One\n\nAs the President and founder of CEDEM AG, I am proud of how far we have come. From the outset, my dream was to create an international brand in the health sector, aligning with my core values. There is nothing more fulfilling than helping others and making a difference, especially for those in need.\n\nMy primary interests lie in solving complex challenges and selling our products worldwide. Gender has never influenced my work ethic; it is discipline and perseverance that have driven my journey.\n\nMy path, as a woman from the Middle East and now thriving in the beautiful country of Switzerland, has been deeply meaningful. Rising from humble beginnings to achieve success has been an inspiring journey, not just for me but for many others. I feel a strong urge to share my experiences to help entrepreneurs who lack access and opportunities. My goal is to leave a legacy of empowerment and fulfillment, ensuring that I “die empty” by giving all I have to offer.\n\nTo further this mission, I established the Amali program. Amali is my life’s destination and purpose, a testament to the beauty of helping others and changing lives. I work tirelessly to invest solely in this program. My vision for Amali is that, in twenty years, it will be a foundation with a global reach, spanning many countries around the world. please visit www.amaliprogram.com\n\nOur Prestigious Partner\nWe Empower women\n\nIn May 2024, we initiated a partnership with FC Basel Women’s Club, marking an exciting new chapter in sports and nutrition. This strategic alliance involves providing our flagship products, VITACED A-Z and CEFORTE, to support the health and performance of women athletes in Switzerland.\n\nVITACED A-Z, a supplement containing 27 essential vitamins and minerals, is crafted to bolster overall health, sustain optimal energy levels, and fortify the immune system. Additionally, CEFORTE, enriched with folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12, promotes red blood cell production, enhances energy metabolism, and reduces fatigue.\n\nThis partnership is a significant milestone for us, expanding our footprint in the Swiss market and emphasizing the role of nutrition in enhancing athletic performance. As a women-owned company, it is crucial to empower women and enable them to achieve their full potential.\n\nOur News\n  \n11\nDEC\nNEWS\nRotary Amman Transform Lives with Hearing Aid for Kids\nJanuary 15, 2025\nIn a heartwarming event at the Hyatt Hotel, sixteen children received life-changing hearing aids as part of the \"Jordanian Hope Hearing...\n\nCONTINUE READING\n\n  \n10\nDEC\nNEWS\nBoost Your Brain: CEDEM BRAINOMAX Now on Amazon USA\nDecember 10, 2024\nCEDEM Switzerland is pleased to announce that CEDEM BRAINOMAX, our advanced brain health supplement, is now available for purchase on A...\n\nCONTINUE READING\n\nREAD MORE\nOur Blogs\nCEDAL Cough Syrup for Relief and Immune Support\nJanuary 19, 2025\nNatural Cough Syrup: CEDAL Cough Syrup for Relief and Immune Support Coughs are among the most common symptoms that disrupt\nContinue Reading\nSupplements Reduce Cortisol: Natural Ways to Balance Stress Hormone Levels\nJanuary 13, 2025\nConclusion Supplements Reduce Cortisol Supplements Reduce Cortisol Cortisol is both a friend and a foe.

I’m Heather\n\nThe Hygienist and founder of Simply Silver. I’d like to share with you why I created Simply Silver Mouthwash. I’ve been a dental hygienist for over 25 years and have seen so many dental patients deal with chronic gingivitis and periodontal disease. Despite fluoride use, they were still developing cavities and dealing with extreme sensitivity. As I began my quest of becoming healthier in all aspects of my life, I just knew there had to be a better way to treat these issues without the harmful and toxic ingredients of commercial products. One day while in my kitchen, God gave me the idea for SSM, all natural toothpaste and mouthwash. SSM is the perfect blend of silver solution, herbs, and essential oils that helps your mouth feel fresh and clean longer.\n\nDitch the #FOMO; Stay in the know\nBecome an SSM insider and get exclusive discounts & perks! \nFirst name\nLast name\nEmail address\nSubscribe\nSimply Silver, Simply Smile!\n\nLearn more about what makes Simply Silver products different then the rest by watching a short clip.\n\nDITCH THE TOXINS!\n\nWe use all-natural ingredients in our Natural Toothpaste and Mouthwash to clean your mouth and keep your breath fresh for hours.

I use it at night on my lower back and it really works for my back pain. I highly recommend! This product works and it does not disappoint!\n\n​\n\nDaise A.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nOmg this stuff must be made of gold. My knees, lower back and sciatica hasn’t been pain free for over 3 months. Thank you.\n\n​\n\nWanda M.\n\n \n\n \n\n​\n\nI brought it at Herb store and it was $40, but I am realizing much less arthritis pain in my ankles...its worth the $$....cheaper than my prescription medications\n\n​\n\nRuthann L.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nIt’s work withe me and I am so happy of this products , thank you meta labs for this perfect products it’s too bad that here in Europe we don’t have a good products like this\n\n \n\nAnas M.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nI ordered this product online It was delivered quickly ..everything was as described. This is a great\n\nproduct to improve your health it!. I would highly recommend it to all my friends.\n\n \n\nLana H.\n\n​\n\nI need to take this moment to thank you once again.\n\nSee the truth is, I have been slowly dying of something us Marines were told in private at the “Portland, VA hospital 2016 in a private room”, “doc said, what you”, “are all fighting makes agent orange look like a joke”!     that the media is never going to mention anything about this disease.\n\n      He said you’ll hear about Agent Orange off and on til the day you die, but I promise you,\n\n     “you will never ever hear anything about this”! Strong (words)!\n\n \n\nthey said it’s going to change your DNA and they continued, it is 40 to 50 years advanced technology.\n\n(More very strong words)!\n\nI didn’t know what to say so I kept my mouth shut.\n\n \n\n       I am only here to tell you that your product is a miracle. It’s literally pulling the infection that I can’t and none of us can seem to get out certain areas like your ankle bone. For instance, you’re able to put a small amount on and continue to go in clockwise or counter clockwise motion and begin to feel things underneath my fingers. It’s wonderful. The swelling in my ankles has almost gone down to normal\n\n    \n\nI’m not exaggerating. It’s gone down 3 inches, I started using your product last summer when a friend literally her name is Linda handed me a full 8 ounce jar of your cream and insisted that it was a gift. She had no idea nor did I what supernaturally happened at that moment.\n\nthank you so much for taking a interest in my venting and praise report\n\nThank you so much Sir or mamm.\n\n​\n\nD.

They tested my blood and were about to prescribe me testosterone, however living in Georgia, they were not permitted to mail it to me. THANK GOD they couldn’t. I heard from a friend of mine about Dr. Taylor and how he helped her with her hormones. I made my appointment and on the first visit he was able to see that I did not need testosterone. He provided me with a saliva test and accurately saw my hormone imbalance had nothing to do with testosterone. He prescribed me, based on the testing, the correct HRT for me. I have never felt better! I feel normal for the first time in years. All because Dr. Taylor and his office treat you, as a person. He and his team care and that is the first thing you will notice when you make your first appointment.\nread more\napril donaldson\n12/21/2023\nGreen Med is an excellent product that will greatly improve your health!\nMargaret Harris\n12/21/2023\nTaylor medical group has helped me so much and the serotonin pills are a life saver!!!!\nPiper Newsom\n12/21/2023\nI have purchased many of these formulations and they all work great.

We differentiate ourselves by having a broad range of specialized ingredients and capabilities, enabling us to find the best solution for our customers. Our capabilities include proprietary ingredients and delivery systems, custom formulation, full turnkey manufacturing, and particle engineering. We’re known in the industry for being the “go to” company for innovative solutions.\n\nPharmachem Innovations is a portfolio company of Turnspire Capital Partners, who acquired the business from Ashland Inc. (NYSE: ASH) in August 2024. As a newly independent company, Pharmachem is well positioned for growth while remaining true to its core values of safety, quality, and technical expertise.\n\nClick here to read the press release.\n\nUpcoming Events\nVisit us at Natural Products Expo West – Booth #4470\nMarch 5-7, 2025 • Anaheim, CA\n\nAre you a natural and organic professional looking to shape the future of your industry? Look no further than Expo West, the unmissable gathering of the CPG and retail ecosystem. Join us in Anaheim and experience the exciting new product concepts we will be showcasing. \n\nWhat We Do\nTailored Solutions\nLearn more\nSpecialty Ingredients\nLearn more\nContract Manufacturing\nLearn more\nFeatured Solutions\nActi-Solve™\nEngineered Solutions\n\nA branded ingredient supplier for sports and health nutrition ingredients ran into functional limitations when using one of their ingredients in a beverage application, and they engaged Pharmachem to find a solution. Our technical team used Pharmachem’s Acti-Solve™ engineered solutions to modify the customer’s ingredient, resulting in a product that has better dispersibility and an improved flavor profile versus the original. This product is currently being introduced into the market and is receiving glowing reviews.\n\nFermented Market-Ready Blends\n\nOne of our most innovative group of ingredients is our GPM™ fermented nutrients. Backed by several clinical studies, these nutrients have improved bioavailability vs. conventional vitamins and minerals. Our technical team has created four new market-ready pre-blends with our GPM™ fermented nutrients, in both a tablet-only and a drum-to-hopper version. New blend formulas include women’s multivitamin, men’s multivitamin, energy blend, and prenatal blend. These blends reduce product development time and help our customers get to market faster.\n\nCustom Hydration\nProducts\n\nA hydration brand came to Pharmachem to help them develop a line of sugar-free electrolyte drinks. We supported them from concept through commercial production, helping their brand scale. In addition to providing formulation expertise, our technical team was able to improve the solubility of a few problematic ingredients. We supply this turnkey solution in a stick-pack, with Pharmachem handling everything from ingredient sourcing to finished goods packaging.\n\nEmerging\nMultivitamin Brand\n\nAn emerging brand had a strong new product concept based on our GPM™ fermented product line but needed a manufacturing partner. We worked closely with the brand owner to bring their product concepts to life, delivering a fully formulated drum-to-hopper blend. The commercialization process included formulation of a blend with desired properties, navigating required regulatory challenges, ensuring the product had the necessary certifications for the targeted end-market, sourcing 50+ raw materials, and then developing a multi-step manufacturing process that ensured a high-quality product. With Pharmachem as their manufacturing partner, the company founders were able to focus on running their business, while Pharmachem handled the manufacturing process from end to end.\n\nCustom Women's\nHealth\n\nAn established women’s health brand needed to launch several new products into a major retailer in very short-time frame. The customer was unique because they had very stringent pharmaceutical quality requirements and desired the finished product to be in the form of a canister containing stick packs. As their partner, we were able to create the formulation, develop the packaging, and produce the desired finished product, all ready for delivery to the retailer on the desired timeline. We proved ourselves as a partner of choice because of our transparency, dedication to quality, manufacturing agility, and formulation expertise.\n\nActi-Solve™\nEngineered Solutions\n\nA branded ingredient supplier for sports and health nutrition ingredients ran into functional limitations when using one of their ingredients in a beverage application, and they engaged Pharmachem to find a solution.

It removed hemp, defined as cannabis (Cannabis Sativa L.) and derivatives of cannabis with extremely low concentrations of the psychoactive compound delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)(no more than 0.3 percent THC on a dry weight basis), from the definition of marijuana in the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The 2018 Farm Bill defines hemp as “any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers with no more than a .03% concentration of delta-9”. [1]\n\nAdditionally, Black Tie CBD complies with the USDA Final Rule [2] , which indicates that a hemp crop is considered to be compliant if it is tested no more than thirty (30) days prior to harvest using a postdecarboxylation method and the results show that the delta-9 THC value does not exceed 0.3% on a dry weight basis: [3]\n\n“Postdecarboxylation. In the context of testing methodologies for THC concentration levels in hemp, means a value determined after the process of decarboxylation that determines the total potential delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content derived from the sum of the THC and THC-A content and reported on a dry weight basis. The postdecarboxylation value of THC can be calculated by using a chromatograph technique using heat, gas chromatography, through which THC-A is converted from its acid form to its neutral form, THC. Thus, this test calculates the total potential THC in a given sample. The postdecarboxylation value of THC can also be calculated by using a high-performance liquid chromatograph technique, which keeps the THC-A intact, and requires a conversion calculation of that THC-A to calculate total potential THC in a given sample.” [4]\n\nThe postdecarboxylation value for THC, as described above, is synonymous with the Total THC in a hemp sample. For this reason, it is clear that a pre-harvested hemp crop is not compliant unless its Total THC concentrations do not exceed 0.3% on a dry weight basis. [5]\n\n‍Total THC Is Not Applicable to Harvested Hemp\nThe USDA Final Rule [6] only governs hemp production and not the regulation of hemp distribution or hemp products which are governed by the Food and Drug Administration Farm Bill. Therefore, after post-harvest, the USDA has no further jurisdiction over the hemp crop leaving the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the only other agency with the authority to regulate the hemp crop. The sole authority on post-harvested hemp is the Farm Bill and its definition specifically defines hemp in terms of its delta-9 THC concentration, not its Total THC content. [7]\n\nOne of the key aspects that allows for a higher concentration of THC-A is that during the thirty (30) day harvest window in which a hemp crop must be tested for THC concentrations, the plant’s cannabinoid concentrations, including THC, continue to increase. [8] For this reason, pre- harvest hemp which has been tested and determined to be compliant may have total THC concentrations that exceed 0.3% when harvested. With that being said, the hemp crop will remain compliance with FDA’s 2018 Farm Bill regulations as long as its delta-9 THC concentration does not surpass 0.3%\n\n‍DEA Regulation of Hemp and Hemp Products\nOn August 21, 2020, the DEA published its Interim Final Rule (IFR) to further clarify that hemp and hemp products are not controlled substances.\n\nIn order to meet the definition of “hemp”, and thus qualify for the exemption from Schedule I, the derivative must not exceed the 0.3% delta-9 THC limit. The definition of “marihuana” continues to state that “all parts of the plant Cannabis Sativa L.” and “every compound manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such plant,” are Schedule I controlled substances unless they meet the definition of “hemp” by falling below the 0.3% delta-9 THC limit on a dry weight basis. [9]\n\nThis ruling confirms that products distributed by Black Tie CBD are not controlled substances as long as their delta-9 THC concentrations do not exceed 0.3% on a dry weight basis.\n\n‍Lawful Transportation of Hemp Products in Interstate Commerce\nThe 2018 Farm Bill legalized industrial hemp at the federal level and included a provision that makes it illegal for states to prohibit the interstate transportation of hemp and hemp products as follows:\n\nNo State or Indian Tribe shall prohibit the transportation or shipment of hemp or hemp products produced in accordance with subtitle G or the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (AMA (as added by section 10113) through the State or the territory of the Indian Tribe, as applicable. [10]\n\nThis ruling makes it clear that Black Tie CBD is allowed to transport and ship hemp or hemp products as long as the products are produced in compliance with the 2018 Farm Bill by not exceeding a delta-9 THC concentration of 0.3% on a dry weight basis. Additionally, Black Tie CBD products will not shipped to states with regulations that have enacted a “Total THC” testing requirement imposing limitations on the requirements set out in the 2018 Farm Bill.\n\n‍Black Tie CBD Federal Product Compliance\nBased on the 2018 Farm Bill, USDA Final Rule, and DEA regulations, Black Tie CBD’s products which contain delta-9 THC concentrations do not exceed 0.3% and are not controlled substances under Federal law. The above rules and regulations specifically define hemp in terms of its delta-9 THC concentrations, not its Total THC content meaning Black Tie CBD products are in full compliance for retail sales and distribution.\n\nWhat's your shipping policy?\n\nSHIPPING INFORMATION\n\n‍At Black Tie CBD we work hard to process your order as quickly as possible.

Black Tie CBD products contain less that 0.3% delta-9 THC which is federally legal as described in the following legislative bills and rules, which establish the legal framework allowing customers to ship Black TieCBD products.\n\n‍2018 Farm Bill\n\n‍In December of 2018, the 2018 Farm Bill was signed into law. It removed hemp, defined as cannabis (Cannabis Sativa L.) and derivatives of cannabis with extremely low concentrations of the psychoactive compound delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (no more than 0.3 percent THC on a dry weight basis), from the definition of marijuana in the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The 2018 Farm Bill defines hemp as “any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers with no more than a 0.3% concentration of delta-9”.1\n\n‍DEA Interim Final Rule (IFR)\n\n‍On August 21, 2020, the DEA published its Interim Final Rule (IFR) to further clarify that hemp and hemp products are not controlled substances. In order to meet the definition of “hemp”, and thus qualify for the exemption from Schedule I, the derivative must not exceed the 0.3% delta-9 THC limit. The definition of “marijuana” continues to state that “all parts of the plant Cannabis Sativa L.” and “every compound manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such plant,” are Schedule I controlled substances unless they meet the definition of “hemp” by falling below the 0.3% delta-9 THC limit on a dry weight basis. 2\n\nThis ruling confirms that products distributed by Black Tie CBD are not controlled substances as long as their delta- 9 THC concentrations do not exceed 0.3% on a dry weight basis.\n\n‍Lawful Transportation and Shipping of Hemp Products in Interstate Commerce\n\n‍The 2018 Farm Bill legalized industrial hemp at the federal level and included a provision that makes it illegal for states to prohibit the interstate transportation of hemp and hemp products as follows: No State or Indian Tribe shall prohibit the transportation or shipment of hemp or hemp products produced in accordance with subtitle G or the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (AMA (as added by section 10113) through the State or the territory of the Indian Tribe, as applicable. 3\n\nThis ruling makes it clear that Black Tie CBD and customers of Black Tie CBD are allowed to transport and ship hemp or hemp products lawfully in commerce as long as the products are produced in compliance with the 201 Farm Bill by not exceeding a delta-9 THC concentration of 0.3% on a dry weight basis.\n\n1 7 U.S.C. §1639o(1)\n2 https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-08-21/html/2020-17356.htm\n3 https://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=132%page=4914#\n\nWhat are THC-A Flowers?\n\nAll (THC dominant) Cannabis is naturally high in THC-A. THC-A is the acidic precursor to THC Delta-9 and naturally forms prior to Delta-9 during the lifecycle of the cannabis plant. THC-A also converts to THC Delta-9 through Decarboxylation, or heat.\n\nDo THCA Flowers get you high?\n\nYes, through the process of decarboxylation, THCA can convert into THC Delta-9, which is psychoactive. Therefore, after undergoing decarboxylation, THC-A flowers will produce euphoric effects when combusted (smoked).\n\nWhat is Decarboxylation?\n\nDecarboxylation is a chemical process that occurs when cannabis is heated, either by smoking, vaporizing, or baking. This process converts non-psychoactive cannabinoids, such as THC-A (tetrahydrocannabinolic acid), into psychoactive cannabinoids, such as THC (tetrahydrocannabinol).\n\nIn the case of marijuana, THC-A is the acidic precursor to THC. THC-A does not have psychoactive effects on its own. Still, when exposed to heat through decarboxylation, it loses a carboxyl group (COOH) and becomes THC, the psychoactive compound responsible for the \"high\" associated with marijuana consumption.\n\nDecarboxylation typically occurs when cannabis is heated to a certain temperature, usually around 220°F to 240°F (104°C to 115°C), for a specific amount of time. This process activates the cannabinoids present in the plant material, making them available for absorption by the body when consumed.\n\nIn summary, decarboxylation is essential for unlocking the full potential of marijuana's psychoactive effects by converting THC-A into THC Delta-9 through the application of heat.\n\nDo you offer wholesale?\n\nYes.  We have listed the steps below to be considered for a wholesale account.\n\n‍Step 1 -   Let us know about your company by emailing us at support@blacktiecbd.net We will need the following information if applicable.\n\n- Copy of valid business license and seller’s permit\n- FEIN Letter from IRS (Form SS-4)\n- Business Name & Location\n- Contact Name Phone Number\n- Email Address\n- A brief description of the type of business (i.e. retail, spa, dispensary, distributor, etc)\n\nMore questions?\nView our FAQs Page\nLet’s be inbox friends\n\nSign up for Special Offers, New Product Releases & learn more about Black Tie CBD\n\nNeed help?

Its medical, preservative, and restorative powers can be traced as far as the ancient Greek and Roman Empires.\n\nRead More\nUses for Nanoparticle Silver\nand Colloidal Metals\n\nWhile we make no health claims about the use or effectiveness of silver colloidal or our product line, our customers have found nanoparticle silver and many of our other products helpful in a wide variety of applications.\n\nRead More\n\t\nWhat are Mesocolloids?\n\nMesocolloids consist of pure elemental metal nanoparticles dispersed in ultra-pure deionized water. The smallest-sized nanoparticles are called mesoparticles. Mesoparticles are microscopic particles whose size is more significant than an atom but smaller than conventional small particles. Size ranges from sub-nanometer to 10 nanometers in diameter, typically consisting of 10 – 30,000 atoms per particle.\n\nThese products consisting of mesoparticles have a particle surface area that is many times greater than particles produced by other methods and are called mesocolloids.\n\nMesocolloids combine small particle size and high concentrations of particles.\n\nbuy provigil online\n\nMesoColloid is a trademarked name that refers to an entire group of metal products that are produced using the mesoprocess. The term mesocolloid was coined by the scientists at the Colloidal Science Labs, who developed the method of producing products consisting of mesoparticles.\n\nOur Meso-World Visualization Tool shows the relative size of the nanoparticle silver particles in Mesosilver\n\nNanoparticle effectiveness is determined by particle surface area\n\nCompared to nanoparticle products produced by other methods, Mesocolloids have the highest particle surface area because of the combination of small particle size and high concentration of particles. See the Comparison Table for comparative examples of nanoparticle silver products. Mesocolloids are characterized by the small size of the mesoparticles that constitute the product and the high percentage of particles vs ions.\n\nMesoColloids have the highest particle surface area​\n\nThe particle surface area increases as the particle size decreases for a constant concentration of metal nanoparticles. In the chemical world, reactivity increases with increasing surface area. Therefore, the effectiveness of nanoparticle solutions increases with decreasing particle size as the particle surface area increases. For this reason, particle surface area serves as a metric for comparing nanoparticle solutions. In metal nanoparticles, the increase in reactivity that derives from the increased particle surface area translates directly to the effectiveness of the colloid. Surface area is expressed in square centimeters (cm2) per milliliter (mL) of nanoparticle solution and is written as (cm2/mL).\n\nView our PCI Product Brochure\nDownload the full brochure\n\n© Purest Colloids 2025\n\n+"

Since 1997, we have developed these products based on the belief that horses should be treated as elite athletes. Elite athletes do not need added sugar to slow them down or fillers to interfere with nutrient absorption. Nor do they need feed grade ingredients with higher levels of heavy metals or carrier ingredients. Instead, your elite equine athlete needs sugar and filler-free supplements made with food grade ingredients to ensure peak performance and health. They also need the superior formulations from the equine performance supplement specialist, Peak Performance Nutrients.\n\nSHOW SAFE \n\nAs a leading manufacturer of performance supplements for competition horses, Peak Performance Nutrients, Inc. understands the importance of formulating products that work as intended without including prohibited ingredients for specific disciplines during competitions.  We created our SHOW SAFE icon to identify products that are formulated with ingredients that do not appear on the banned list of ingredients so they are acceptable for all types of competitions.  Look for the SHOW SAFE icon next to each product or call our Customer Service Team for help in deciding which products are acceptable for those subject to in-competition testing. We encourage you to verify our ingredients with the lists shown on FEICleanSport, USEF or the governing body for the discipline in which you are competing.\n\nZERO SUGAR HORSE SUPPLEMENTS\n\nExcess sugar or carbohydrate intake over a period of time can cause insulin resistance, a condition similar to Type II diabetes in humans. Constant high levels of unused insulin in the body can lead to loss of weight, loss of muscle, lack of stamina and laminitis. Because of these issues, all of our products are formulated without using any sugars or \"sweet flavorings.\"\n\nFILLER FREE HORSE SUPPLEMENTS\n\nFeeding filler free supplements provides several benefits. Fillers (such as alfalfa) are often used to enlarge the dose size giving the impression that horse owners \"are getting more for their money\" when in fact they are feeding less active ingredient per serving. Since horses have lower nutrient absorption rates, these fillers can interfere with the absorption of the active ingredients.\n\nHORSE JOURNAL RATINGS\n\nTwo of our products, Ex Stress and Perfect Balance Electrolite, have been named \"Product of the Year\" by The Horse Journal. Additionally, seven of our products have been recommended and twelve products in all have been favorably reviewed. Since 1997, Peak Performance Nutrients has been formulating and manufacturing award-winning, effective products.\n\nWE ARE THE MANUFACTURER\n\nAll of our energy is spent researching and manufacturing supplements. Nothing else. Because we are the manufacturer, we have total control over the quality of our raw materials, the cleanliness of our GMP compliant facilities and the accuracy of our products so you can rest assured you are purchasing a quality product for your horse.\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nSign up with your email address to receive news and updates.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nWe respect your privacy.\n\nCONTACT US\n\nPO Box 294036\nBoca Raton, FL 33429\nemail: info@peakperformancenutrients.com\ntoll free: (800) 944-1984\noutside US/Canada: (561) 266-1038\n\nHOME PAGE\nALL PRODUCTS\nJOURNAL REVIEWS\nBLOG\nNEWSLETTER\n SIGN UP\n©2024 PEAK PERFORMANCE NUTRIENTS, INC.

We understand the importance of ethically sourced ingredients and sustainable methods!\n\nLet customers speak for us\nfrom 159 reviews\nWe give to our personal and rescue dogs!\n\nI have seen, time and time again, how well this product works for dogs with hip and joint issues. As a dog rescue, we have had hundreds of dogs come to us or age with us who have bad joints. We've given it to dogs who were recommended surgery for knee injuries (such as torn ACL) and it helped them so much that surgery was avoided. Dogs with minimal joint movement in hips to the point they couldn't stand on their hind legs or walk very far were soon moving much better and able to stand on their hind legs to give hugs or hop in the car. The combination in this supplement works very well. We recommend this product to all of our adopters and use on our personal dogs!\n\nS.M.\nGreat product\n\nNot only does our dog love them, they have cleared up what looked like a heat rash that he got off and on in the crook of his legs!\n\nDeVonna Stephens\n\nThese help my senior dog Buddy\n\nNicole\nAll the STARS\n\nOur puppy is less than 2 years old but has hip dysplasia in both hips. We had already tried other joint supplements and only saw minimal improvement after 5-6 months. After trying Mobility, we saw a lot of improvement in just 2 months and we’re hoping for even more. When we first started, she could hardly get over the door jamb and her legs would quiver when she had to stand to eat or drink. Now she’s able to trot along after our other puppy. She’ll probably never be as strong as she was before but she’s a whole new puppy from the way she has been for the last 6-8 months.\n\nWe’re very happy with Lively Paws and don’t plan on ever letting her run out.\n\nVicki Cunningham\nWent from struggling to get up, to having zoomies again.\n\nI recently took in a 14 year old dog from a friend who could no longer care for her. Her coat was thin, shedding constantly, and getting up and walking was becoming a challenge.\n\nShe has been on the mobility chews for almost a month now and she had the zoomies yesterday! Getting up hasn’t been a problem, her hips aren’t giving out while she’s standing anymore, and she’s able to go on longer walks. Her coat is even looking better and she’s shedding less.\n\nI’ve used these in the past for other senior dogs and it’s amazing to watch them improve every time. If you’re skeptical, just buy them. You won’t regret it and the faster you get your pet on these, the faster you get your old pal back.\n\nCourtney\nExcellent product\n\nBlitz was on Glucosamine for many years and his hind legs were getting worse, after a few months on Lively Paws Mobility he is doing excellent. doing stairs and taking long walks, he has been on it now for well over 2 years and just turned 14 on October 1, 2022. I highly recommend this product.\n\nDeborah Auletta\n\nIt helped my babygirl out a lot.\n\nAyesha\n\nMy 9 years old pup was having trouble getting up and your product has in the short time of using it, has made a drastic change. Thank you for thinking of our pets. Much ❤️\n\nAyesha\nGreat product, love it\n\nMy dog loves the probiotic taste and i love how they've improved her poops.\nTotally recommended\n\nAvy Rocha\nMobility\n\nTried other products and this has been the #1 product for the last 2 years. Also, had a slight mishap and company took care of it with no ?s asked. Couldn't ask for better customer service. Would highly recommend.\n\nP.B.\nMobility\n\nLove this product and highly recommend it. Our dog was having some mobility issues in his rear legs 2 years ago, he was having problems with stairs and getting up on the bed. I started giving him Lively Paws Mobility, and within a few months there were no longer signs that he ever had an issue. He is going to be 14 in October, and he has no issues with stairs or getting up on furniture. I'm so happy I found this product and took the chance to try it.\n\nDeborah Auletta\nFlorida thunder storms, We got this !\n\nThe Lively Paws Calm has really helped my two Corgi's stay calm during the loud Florida thunder and lightening storms. They are 1 and 3 years old. It has made a big difference in their comfort level. Love this product!\n\nElizabeth C\nWe love these to help us stay calm!\n\nThese are so helpful when our mommy has to go out. We are pandemic pups and not used to being alone so we have separation anxiety. These really help us remain calm. They also taste really good!\n\nJosie Blitzer\nGood for any age!\n\nEven though the Longevity supplement is intended for Senior Dogs, I find that this supplement has helped my dog who is just 3 years old. When receiving the product, the chews were soft and they remained soft until my pup completed the supplements. I love that they do not contain any corn, wheat, milk, eggs, soy, potatoes, potato starch, sugar, GMO or artificial preservatives or fillers. I truly believe these help my GSD with his allergies. I've noticed less scratching despite it being allergy season. Super helpful and would purchase again!\n\nEmma Widmar\nBest ever!\n\nReally love these chews! Duke has been waking up full of life and so much more playful! We’ve tried other brands and never saw much of a difference but after being on these for a month, I can tell his hips are much happier!\n\nCasey Flock\nHow They Work\n\n“Pets are very similar to us in that as they age their bodies don’t produce the same level of naturally occurring chemicals to help in various aspects of a healthy life,” explains Michael Stoeckle, president and CEO of Ark Naturals Company. “As a result, supplementing their diet with these naturally occurring ingredients (or something that works in the same way) allows them to live a healthier and more satisfying life by addressing the loss of that particular chemical that would otherwise be naturally occurring in their body. \n\n“It could be for stopping inflammation, assisting in digestion, providing moisture to offset a dry coat, boosting their immunity to help fight plaque and tartar etc…,” he continues. These products are not intended to be food, nor are they intended to prevent, treat or cure any disease or condition. Nevertheless, these types of products may support a variety of a healthy pet’s normal functions.” \n\nWhy Buy From Lively Paws?\nOur Trusted Team of Veterinarians\n\nDr. Joanne Intile, DVM, MS, DACVIM\n\nVeterinary oncologist Linkedin\n\nDr. Intile is a board-certified veterinary oncologist.

As a company made up of reptile hobbyists, we strive to provide the supplies and knowledge needed to successfully care for reptiles, amphibians, fish, insects and other exotic pets to keep them happy and healthy.\n\nThe reptile supplies, accessories, and tools we manufacture are first tested at our office on the private collection of animals we house here. Many of us have desk pets, and many of those desks are wedged into places inbetween the 200+ terrariums, aquariums, paludariums, and other habitats at our facility. Inside our Animal Room we house over 90 species ranging from chameleons, geckos, skinks, frogs, fish, newts, tarantulas, and beetles. Outside in our Turtle Nirvana Greenhouse, we care for 30 species of turtles and tortoises, several of which are endangered.\n\nBreeding and caring for these animals daily sets us apart by giving us a clear understanding of fellow hobbyists’ needs and those of their animals. We love our pets and truly are a company of pet people for pet people!\n\nWhether you are an experienced reptile snake breeder or gecko breeder working with hundreds of animals, or you’re looking into picking up your first pet bearded dragon, Zoo Med is sure to have what you need.\n\nMake zoomed.com your top resource for Care Sheets, UVB and Heat Lighting Guides, Reptile Substrate/Impaction Guides, Reptile Show Dates and more!

High cortisol levels directly reduce immune system, and lymphatic health is critical for longterm wellness as it provides the first line of defense against disease.\n\nThis is precisely why INTERNAL aftercare is so IMPORTANT!! Because the heavy lifting of healing your tattoo happens beneath your skin, which is untouched by externally applied ointments.\n\nAdd to Cart\n\nTerms_and_conditions\n\nPrivacy_policy\n\nDid you know that fruit should be eaten alone to optimize gut health?

To meet this demand, and with the business philosophy of honest, integrity, and a sense of fairness, the company experienced significant growth in the past couple of years.\n\nAfter many years of growth, Bosgen Inc. has grown into a company that has the following capabilities:\n1. We provide recycling services (primarily for post-industrial streams) for manufacturers in the US. Our primary customers are in the east coast, midwest, and southern United States.

We do so by having offerings that our competitors can't offer. We sell a lot of natural, organic and specialty foods and we do not have our own private label. UNFI has offered a line of products that allows us to compete, which has become our private label.\"\n\nRick Silvia Dave's Marketplace\n\n\"We have been in business for over 40 years and have been a partner with UNFI from the very beginning. UNFI has such a wide reach that all types of consumers are able to buy our products. UNFI's marketing programs have helped us successfully launch products to reach retailers and consumers\"\n\nKim Butterfield VP of Sales & Marketing, New England Natural Bakers, INC.\n\n\"UNFI helped us solve our reach. UNFI became a one stop shop for us to access a much larger range of customers. UNFI provided services that most distributors don't provide. UNFI helped us grow from a small producer to a large producer.\"\n\nJeff Weaber CEO & Founder, Aqua ViTea\n\n\"We have partnered with UNFI since 2002, and it just continues to get better. Our natural selection has greatly improved and our business with UNFI has doubled. Because of our partnership we are able to offer the best products to our community. \"\n\nDerek Oliver Buyer, Fruit Center Marketplace\n\n\"We started as a retail business, but UNFI helped us to grow so much that wholesale is now our number one market. UNFI has helped us scale our business in distribution.\"\n\nAnthony Green Co-Founder, Greenhouse\n\n\"Before the doors opened at Urban Greens, we had already partnered with UNFI. We knew that they offered all of the healthy food we wanted to carry. The choices of organic, Non-GMO and conventional products were a perfect fit for our business.\"\n\nAllyn Jones Purchasing Manager, Urban Greens Co-op\n\n“The introduction of UNFI into our business has been great because we can service a nice middle tier of the business on a nationwide basis through a really reputable distributor.

Niacinamide and Niacin are twin vitamins with B3 status, but they are not identical. The difference is that Niacinamide is bound with amino acids, which prevents the flush effect (burning or tingling sensation of the face, chest, or neck), which frequently occurs with niacin supplementation. Niacinamide is required to properly function fats and sugars in the body and maintain healthy cells.\n\n\nBEAUTY - keeps skin smooth and moisturized; reduces inflammation, which may help ease redness from eczema, acne, and other inflammatory skin conditions. It also helps build keratin, a type of protein that keeps your skin firm and healthy.\nMETABOLIZE - aids in the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins\nREGULATES OIL - The benefits of moisture retention aren’t just for those with dry skin types. Niacinamide can also help regulate the amount of oil the sebaceous glands produce; and prevent your glands from going into overdrive.\nHELPS PROTECTS AGAINST OXIDATIVE STRESS - Niacinamide helps build cells in the skin while protecting them from environmental stressors, such as sunlight, pollution, and toxins.\n\n\n\n\nNPN: 80079086\n\nSize: 90 Capsules\nADD TO CART\n$13.99\nMore payment options\nView product details\nFEATURED ARTICLE\nBEE PRODUCTS: WHATS THE BUZZ ABOUT?\n\nHoney, Propolis, and Royal Jelly are nature’s sweet superfoods made by the buzzing busy bees we all love (and not so love).

Good oral hygiene is important for a healthy life, and every person should make sure that they maintain their teeth in the best condition possible. This will require regular visits to the dentist and proper care at home. Sometimes, you also need to จัดฟันกับร้านในฝั่งธน. If you have a dental problem, visit the best Pracha Uthit-Suksawat dental clinic to get professional dental services that will help you keep your oral hygiene at its finest. But what services do professional dentists in Pracha Uthit-Suksawat offer?\n\nHow do these dental services work, and most importantly, how can you find the best Pracha Uthit-Suksawat dental clinic for your dental needs? In this post, we’ll discuss everything you need to know about professional dental services and how you can choose the best clinic.\n\nTeeth Whitening\n\nWho doesn’t want a dazzling, Hollywood-worthy smile? At Pracha Uthit-Suksawat Dental Clinic, they offer expert teeth whitening treatments to brighten up your pearly whites. Say goodbye to those stubborn stains caused by coffee, tea, or tobacco. Their professional techniques and state-of-the-art equipment will leave you with a radiant smile that’s sure to turn heads.\n\nTeeth Cleaning\n\nSometimes, even with regular care, plaque and tartar can build up on our teeth. That’s where professional teeth cleaning comes in. A dental hygienist will use special tools to remove the stubborn buildup, leaving your pearly whites fresh and squeaky clean. It’s a quick and painless procedure that helps prevent cavities, gum disease, and bad breath. So don’t skip those routine cleanings – your smile will thank you.\n\nExtraction\n\nDespite our tremendous amounts of efforts to keep our teeth healthy, extraction becomes necessary. Whether it’s due to severe decay, infection, or overcrowding, the skilled dentists at Pracha Uthit-Suksawat Dental Clinic can perform extractions with utmost precision and care. They understand that this procedure may cause anxiety for some patients, so they ensure a gentle and painless experience.\n\nBraces or Invisalign\n\nAre you looking for the best way to achieve a straighter smile? At Pracha Uthit-Suksawat Dental Clinic, you can get both traditional braces and Invisalign as options for orthodontic treatment. Braces basically use metal brackets and wires to gradually move your teeth into alignment, while Invisalign uses specialized clear aligner trays that are virtually invisible.\n\nDental Crowns\n\nBut what if you’re dealing with a cracked or damaged tooth? Dental crowns can be a game-changer. These custom-made caps are properly placed over your natural tooth to instantly restore its original shape, size, and strength. Not only do they protect your teeth from further damage, but they also enhance their appearance.\n\nRoot Canal Therapy\n\nNow, if you’re suffering from a severely infected or decayed tooth, root canal therapy can remove the infected pulp and alleviate pain. The dentist will usually thoroughly clean and seal the tooth to prevent further infection. Don’t worry, modern techniques make this treatment much more comfortable than in the past.\n\nIn a nutshell, when it comes to professional dental services, the Pracha Uthit-Suksawat Dental Clinic is your go-to destination. Whether you’re looking to brighten up your smile with teeth whitening or maintain optimal oral health with regular teeth cleaning, the clinic has got you covered.\n\nFind us below:\n\nรวมทันตแพทย์คลินิก\nที่อยู่: 810 19 ซอย ประชาอุทิศ 17 เขตราษฎร์บูรณะ กรุงเทพมหานคร 10140\nโทร: 095-713-0027\n\n…\n\nREAD MORE\n\nPOSTED ON 2024-01-31\n\n By Julien Owery  0\nHow Balancing Your Blood Sugar Levels Can Help You Achieve Sustainable Weight Loss\n\nAchieving sustainable weight loss is a goal for many individuals, but it often proves to be a challenging and frustrating process. While numerous factors contribute to weight management, one crucial aspect that is often overlooked is blood sugar regulation. By understanding the impact of blood sugar levels on weight loss, individuals can adopt strategies to maintain consistent levels and enhance their efforts.\n\nThis article will explore the top ways to balance blood sugar levels and promote sustainable weight loss.\n\nMindful Eating\n\nOne of the most effective ways to balance blood sugar levels is through mindful eating. This practice involves paying full attention to the whole eating experience, from food choices to portion sizes and eating speed. Mindful eating encourages individuals to listen to their body’s hunger and fullness cues, promoting a healthy relationship with food.\n\nRegular Physical Activity\n\nRegular physical activity plays a crucial role in weight loss and blood sugar regulation. Engaging in moderate-intensity exercises, such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming, helps improve insulin sensitivity by facilitating glucose uptake into muscles. This results in more controlled blood sugar levels and enhanced fat burning. Aim for more than150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week, while including strength training exercises to increase muscle mass, which further aids in balancing blood sugar levels while supporting sustainable weight loss.\n\nAdequate Sleep\n\nSleep is often overlooked when it comes to weight loss, but it plays a significant role in blood sugar regulation. Lack of sleep can disrupt hormones involved in appetite control, leading to cravings for sugary and high-calorie foods. Additionally, inadequate sleep can impair insulin sensitivity, leading to elevated blood sugar levels and weight gain.\n\nStress Management\n\nChronic stress triggers the release of stress hormones like cortisol, which can significantly impact blood sugar regulation and weight management. High cortisol levels increase appetite and promote the accumulation of visceral fat around the abdomen. Incorporating stress management techniques such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, yoga, or engaging in hobbies can help reduce cortisol levels, improve insulin sensitivity, and promote sustainable weight loss.\n\nBy practicing mindful eating, engaging in regular physical activity, prioritizing adequate sleep, and implementing stress management techniques, individuals can regulate their blood sugar levels effectively. These lifestyle modifications not only support sustainable weight loss but also contribute to overall well-being and long-term health.…\n\nREAD MORE\n\nPOSTED ON 2023-11-12\n\n By Julien Owery  0\nAgeless Golf: How Seniors Can Enjoy the Game and Stay Healthy\n\nGolf is one of those timeless sports that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, making it a favorite pastime for many seniors. Not only does golf offer an opportunity to socialize and enjoy the great outdoors, but it also provides several health benefits that are particularly valuable for older adults. SIGPRO Softy golf practice mat is an ideal option for seniors looking to stay healthy and improve their golf game. In this article, we’ll explore how seniors can enjoy the game of golf and stay healthy, both physically and mentally.\n\nPhysical Health Benefits for Seniors\n\nAs we age, it’s important to stay physically active and engage in activities that promote strength, flexibility, and balance. Golf provides all of these benefits and more. Here are some ways that seniors can benefit from playing golf:\n\nCardiovascular Exercise: Walking on the golf course for 18 holes is equivalent to a 3-4 mile walk, providing excellent cardiovascular exercise for seniors.\nLow-Impact Activity: Unlike other sports that can be hard on the joints, golf is a low-impact activity that puts less stress on the body, making it suitable for seniors with conditions such as arthritis.\nImproved Balance and Coordination: The repetitive motion of swinging a golf club can help improve balance and coordination, reducing the risk of falls and injuries.\nSun Exposure: Spending time outdoors in the sun can help seniors get their daily dose of vitamin D, which is essential for strong bones and a healthy immune system.\nStress Relief: Golf is known to be a relaxing sport that can provide stress relief, reducing the risk of heart disease and other health issues associated with chronic stress.\nMental Health Benefits for Seniors\n\nBeing on the golf course can also have a positive impact on mental health, offering seniors a chance to clear their minds and focus on the present moment. Here are some ways that golf can benefit seniors mentally:\n\nSocialization: Golf is a social sport that offers an opportunity for seniors to connect with others and build friendships. This can help combat feelings of loneliness and isolation, which are common among older adults.\nMental Stimulation: Golf requires strategy and focus, which can help keep the mind sharp and improve cognitive function in seniors.\nRelaxation: The peaceful surroundings of a golf course and the rhythmic sound of swinging a club can promote relaxation and reduce anxiety and depression in seniors.\nSense of Accomplishment: Successfully completing a round of golf, whether it’s shooting a low score or simply enjoying the game, can boost self-esteem and provide a sense of accomplishment for seniors.\nTips for Seniors to Enjoy Golf Safely\n\nWhile golf can be a great activity for seniors, it’s important to take precautions and stay safe on the course. Here are some tips:\n\nWarm Up: Before hitting the links, make sure to warm up your muscles with some stretching exercises to prevent injuries.\nUse Proper Equipment: Make sure to use golf clubs and balls that are suitable for your age and physical capabilities.\nStay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, especially on hot days.\nFollow Course Rules: Always follow the rules of the course, including proper golf etiquette, to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone.\nListen to Your Body\n\nGolf is a sport that seniors can enjoy while reaping numerous health benefits. Its low-impact nature, combined with the mental and social engagement it offers, makes it an ideal pastime for older adults.

However, before diving into the world of diets and exercise routines, it’s essential to consider the expertise of health professionals. Consulting with healthcare experts, such as doctors, nutritionists, and fitness trainers, can provide valuable insights and personalized guidance that are crucial for a successful and sustainable weight loss journey.\n\nPersonalized Health Assessment\n\nEvery individual is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another. Health experts can conduct a comprehensive assessment of your current health status, taking into account factors such as medical history, pre-existing conditions, and lifestyle. This personalized approach allows for the creation of a weight loss plan fit for your specific needs, ensuring both effectiveness and safety.\n\nIdentification of Underlying Health Issues\n\nWeight gain can sometimes be a symptom of underlying health issues such as hormonal imbalances, thyroid disorders, or metabolic issues. Consulting with health professionals can help identify these potential issues that might be hindering your weight loss efforts. Addressing the root cause is essential for long-term success and overall health improvement.\n\nSafe and Sustainable Weight Loss Strategies\n\nHealth experts can guide you toward safe and sustainable weight loss strategies. Fad diets and extreme exercise regimens may promise rapid results but often lead to short-term success with long-term consequences. A health professional can help you adopt a balanced approach, focusing on gradual changes to your diet and exercise routine that are realistic and maintainable in the long run.\n\nNutritional Guidance\n\nNutrition plays a pivotal role in any weight loss journey. Health experts, particularly nutritionists, can provide valuable insights into creating a well-rounded and nutrient-dense diet plan. They can help you understand the importance of portion control, the right balance of macronutrients, and the inclusion of essential vitamins and minerals. This knowledge not only supports weight loss but also contributes to overall health and vitality.\n\nCustomized Exercise Plans\n\nA one-size-fits-all approach to exercise is often ineffective and can even lead to injuries. Fitness trainers and healthcare professionals can assess your current fitness level, any limitations you may have, and your personal preferences to design a customized exercise plan. This tailored approach ensures that your workouts are both enjoyable and effective, reducing the risk of burnout and increasing the likelihood of long-term adherence.\n\nMonitoring and Adjustments\n\nWeight loss is a dynamic process that requires continuous monitoring and adjustments. Health experts can track your progress, assess the effectiveness of your plan, and make necessary adjustments based on your evolving needs and goals. Regular check-ins with professionals provide accountability and support, enhancing your chances of success.\n\nStarting a weight loss journey is a significant step toward improving your health and well-being. However, the path to success is smoother and more sustainable when guided by the expertise of health professionals. Consultation with doctors, nutritionists, and fitness trainers ensures a personalized and safe approach, addressing potential health issues and providing the necessary tools for a successful and lasting transformation. Before taking the plunge, consider the invaluable support that health experts can offer on your weight loss journey.…\n\nREAD MORE\n\nPOSTED ON 2023-10-30\n\n By Julien Owery  0\nHow to Prepare Yourself before Undergoing a Testosterone Test \n\nAre you considering getting a testosterone test? Whether it’s for medical reasons or simply out of curiosity, being prepared is key to ensuring accurate results. Before you roll up your sleeves and head to the lab, take a moment to read through these essential tips on how to prepare yourself before undergoing a testosterone test. Of course, an at home testosterone test is still one preferred option. But still, preparation is key here. From fasting requirements to medication instructions, we’ve got you covered.\n\nFollow Fasting Requirements\n\nWhen preparing for a testosterone test, following fasting requirements is crucial. Most healthcare providers recommend fasting for at least 8 hours before the test. This means no food or drink, except water, during this period. Why is fasting necessary? Well, certain foods and beverages can affect the results of your testosterone levels. By abstaining from eating and drinking (aside from water), you ensure that your body’s natural hormone production won’t be influenced by what you’ve consumed recently. It’s important to note that even seemingly innocent items like coffee with creamer or a glass of juice in the morning can interfere with accurate results.\n\nAvoid Strenuous Exercise\n\nWhen preparing for a testosterone test, it is essential to avoid engaging in strenuous exercise. While regular physical activity is generally recommended for maintaining overall health and well-being, intense workouts can affect the results of your testosterone levels. Engaging in high-intensity exercise before a testosterone test can cause temporary fluctuations in hormone levels. This means that if you have recently completed an intense workout session, it could skew the results of your blood work. So, it’s best to take it easy and refrain from any vigorous activities at least 24 hours before the test. Instead of hitting the gym or going for a long run right before your appointment, opt for light exercises like walking or gentle stretching. These activities will keep you active without putting excessive strain on your body.\n\nReview Medication Instructions\n\nWhen preparing for a testosterone test, it’s crucial to review any medication instructions you may have received. This step is often overlooked but can significantly impact the accuracy of your results. Each medication has its guidelines and potential effects on hormone levels, so it’s essential to know how they could affect your test. Start by gathering all the medications you take regularly or occasionally. This includes prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, and even herbal supplements. Take note of their names and dosages, as this information will be helpful when discussing with your healthcare provider. Next, carefully read through the instructions provided with each medication. Pay attention to any warnings about potential interactions or interference with hormone tests.\n\nLimit Alcohol Consumption\n\nAlcohol is a standard part of many social gatherings and celebrations, but it’s important to remember that excessive drinking can have negative effects on your testosterone levels. Before undergoing a testosterone test, it’s essential to limit your alcohol consumption. When you consume alcohol, it can interfere with the production and regulation of hormones in the body, including testosterone. Excessive drinking has been linked to decreased testosterone levels in both men and women. Moreover, alcohol can also lead to dehydration, which can affect blood volume and potentially impact hormone concentration in the bloodstream. This could possibly skew the results of your testosterone test. To ensure accurate results from your testosterone test, avoid consuming alcoholic beverages for at least 24-48 hours before the test. This will allow enough time for any potential effects on hormone levels to subside.\n\nBy taking these steps beforehand, you actively contribute to a successful testosterone test outcome. So, take charge of your health and ensure you’re properly prepared for this critical assessment. Stay proactive in managing your well-being by being informed and knowledgeable about the necessary preparations for any medical tests or procedures. Your dedication will pay off as it ensures accurate results and helps guide appropriate treatment plans if needed.

Just like in a car, you want the fuel gauge to stay in the middle, not too high, and certainly not too low. But sometimes, the balance gets thrown off, and you experience those pesky blood sugar spikes and crashes. There are blood sugar supplements that will help you regulate blood sugar levels, but let’s first dive into the causes and prevention methods for blood sugar spikes and crashes.\n\nWhat Are Blood Sugar Spikes and Crashes?\n\nLet’s start with the basics. Blood sugar, or glucose, is the sugar in your blood that serves as your body’s primary source of energy. When your blood sugar levels rise too quickly, it’s called a “spike,” and when they drop rapidly, it’s a “crash.” These fluctuations can be caused by a variety of factors, including diet, exercise, stress, and certain health conditions.\n\nCauses of Blood Sugar Spikes\n\nThere are several common causes of blood sugar spikes, including:\n\nCarbohydrate Overload: One of the most common causes of spikes is consuming too many simple carbohydrates. Think sugary snacks, soft drinks, and refined grains. Your body absorbs the sugar from these foods quickly, causing a spike.\nInsufficient Insulin: In people with diabetes, the absence or insufficient production of insulin can lead to blood sugar spikes. Insulin is essential for regulating blood sugar levels.\nStress: Stress triggers the release of stress hormones, which can lead to higher blood sugar levels. Your body prepares for a “fight or flight” response, causing a spike.\nPhysical Inactivity: Lack of physical activity can lead to insulin resistance, making it harder for your body to regulate blood sugar levels.\nCauses of Blood Sugar Crashes\n\nOn the flip side, blood sugar crashes can occur for several reasons, such as:\n\nSkipping Meals: When you go long periods without eating, your body may not have enough glucose to maintain stable blood sugar levels. This can cause a crash.\nHigh Insulin Levels: Too much insulin in your body can cause a rapid drop in blood sugar levels. This can be caused by overproduction of insulin, taking too much medication for diabetes, or excessive exercise.\nAlcohol Consumption: Drinking alcohol can interfere with the liver’s ability to release stored glucose into the bloodstream, leading to low blood sugar levels.\nCertain Medications: Some medications, such as those for diabetes or high blood pressure, can cause blood sugar crashes as a side effect.\nHow to Prevent Blood Sugar Spikes and Crashes\n\nNow that you understand the causes of these fluctuations, here are some tips to help prevent them:\n\nEat a Balanced Diet: Focus on incorporating complex carbohydrates, lean proteins, and healthy fats into your meals to avoid blood sugar spikes. These foods take longer to digest, preventing a quick rise in blood sugar levels.\nExercise Regularly: Physical activity helps your body use insulin more effectively, preventing blood sugar spikes and crashes. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily.\nMonitor Your Blood Sugar Levels: If you have diabetes, it’s crucial to regularly check your blood sugar levels and make adjustments to medication or diet as needed.\nManage Stress: Incorporate stress-reducing activities into your daily routine, such as yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises.\nIn Conclusion\n\nBlood sugar spikes and crashes can be quite the mood busters and energy drainers. But with some simple lifestyle adjustments and mindful eating, you can maintain stable blood sugar levels and keep your body running like a well-oiled machine. Your body will thank you with consistent energy and overall well-being.…\n\nREAD MORE\n\nPOSTED ON 2023-03-22\n\n By Julien Owery  0\nTop Myths About Human Growth Hormone Injections\n\nSteroids, protein supplements, and human growth hormone injections are all becoming increasingly popular among athletes. But among all, human growth hormone (HGH) has a number of potential benefits with fewer side effects for those looking to improve their performance in the gym or on the field. At these crazy bulk reviews, you’ll find one of the best HGH supplements. But if you’ve been in the community for a while, you know tons of myths about HGH injections circulate around. For example, do you also believe that HGH will only give you a pot belly? Well, read on. Today, we’re going to reveal the truths and debunk popular myths about HGH. Let’s get started.\n\nDead Brain Cells Are the Main Formula for HGH\n\nOkay, you may have heard it quite a lot. But in fact, it was true. Back in the 1980s, scientists were able to extract human growth hormone from cadavers’ pituitary glands and use it for various treatments. This led to the belief that HGH was associated with dead brain cells, although this is far from true now. In today’s technology, HGH is synthetically produced from recombinant DNA technology and can also be extracted from other living organisms.\n\nHGH Injections Alone Can Make You Bulk Up\n\nIt’s a common misconception among athletes, bodybuilders, and fitness enthusiasts. But in truth, human growth hormone helps to reduce fat levels while maintaining muscle mass – making it an excellent supplement for those looking to stay fit and toned. However, note that by themselves, HGH injections don’t create bulk. In order to build muscle, one needs a combination of proper diet and exercise as well as the right hormones or supplements. So if you’re considering using HGH injections for bodybuilding purposes, make sure you have a balanced diet and a consistent training program to go along with it.\n\nIt Can Often Lead to Abnormal Bone Growth\n\nThere is no scientific evidence to support this argument. In fact, studies have found that HGH injections can help improve bone density and help treat conditions such as osteoporosis. That being said, bear in mind that when used in excess or without medical guidance, human growth hormone injections may result in abnormal growth of bones or muscles. So if you’re thinking about using HGH injections, it’s best to consult with your doctor first and get professional advice.\n\nIt Can Be Used as a Substitute for Sleep\n\nThere is a popular opinion that some people use HGH injections to “make up” for lost sleep by providing them with enough energy and focus throughout the day. However, this isn’t true at all. Human growth hormone injections are used to regulate metabolism and help repair tissue, but they can’t replace the need for rest and proper sleep. The amazing benefits of sleep can’t be replaced with anything else – no matter how many injections you take.\n\nHuman growth hormone injections are becoming increasingly popular among athletes and bodybuilders, but knowing the facts before using them is important. The truth is that HGH can be used for a variety of reasons, from reducing fat levels to improving bone density, but only when taken in the right amounts and with medical guidance. So if you’re considering using HGH injections for any reason, consult your doctor first and get professional advice.…\n\nREAD MORE\n\nPOSTED ON 2022-04-11\n\n By Julien Owery  0\nReduce Your Medical Bills for a Surgery With These Tips\n\nWe mostly don’t want surgery, but we need it. If you are like most people, you are probably dreading having to pay your medical bills after surgery. The good news is that you can do a few things to reduce the amount of money you have to pay. Anyways, in this blog post, we will discuss some helpful tips that can help reduce your medical bills. Keep in mind that each situation is unique, and you should speak with your doctor or financial advisor to get specific advice for your situation. But here are some general tips to get you started.\n\nNegotiate a Lower Price With the Hospital\n\nIf you face surgery, you should first try to negotiate a lower price with the hospital. It may seem daunting, but it is definitely worth your time and effort. However, before the negotiation, you should start by asking for a list of charges from the hospital. It will give you a starting point for negotiation. Also, don’t be afraid to ask for a discount. Remember, the hospital will not likely provide you with a lower price if you don’t ask. It’s also best to be prepared to negotiate. You may need to call multiple times or speak with different people before getting the price you want.\n\nScan Your Medical Bills for Any Errors\n\nAfter receiving your medical bills, it’s important to scan them for any errors. This is something that many people overlook, but it can save you a lot of money. Medical billing is notoriously complex, and mistakes are not uncommon. So, take the time to go over your bill line by line to ensure everything looks correct. If you see anything that doesn’t make sense, don’t hesitate to reach out to the hospital for an explanation. They should be able to help you resolve the issue.\n\nCheck With Your Insurance Company\n\nAnother thing you can do to reduce your medical bills is to check with your insurance company to see if the surgery is covered. Often, surgeries are considered medically necessary and are covered by most insurance companies. However, it’s always best to check with your specific insurer to be sure. They may have some exceptions that you are not aware of. If your surgery is not covered by insurance, there are still a few options available. You may be able to get financial assistance from the hospital or set up a payment plan.\n\nAsk for Less Expensive Alternatives\n\nIf you are facing surgery, it’s important to remember that less expensive treatments may be available as an alternative. Often, surgery is not the only option. So, be sure to ask your doctor if there are any less expensive options that could work for you. They may be able to recommend a less invasive procedure or medication that could save you money.\n\nThere you have it. These are just a few tips that can help you reduce your medical bills for surgery. Again, keep in mind that each situation is unique, and you should speak with your doctor or financial advisor to get specific advice for your situation. But these tips should give you a good starting point.…\n\nREAD MORE\n\nPOSTED ON 2021-09-05\n\n By Julien Owery  0\nBenefits of Using Weight Loss Pills\n\nTrying to lose weight without positive results can be frustrating.

Even though every person comes for a particular reason, they soon discover that chiropractic brings many benefits beyond reducing a particular symptom. It is a procedure that should be administered by professionals.\n\nChiropractic aims to improve the functioning of the nervous system. In this way, brain and body communication works correctly, and the organism can self-regulate and adapt without interruptions and interference. When the body is not using as much energy on basic things, there is more energy for everything else. The following are some of the common benefits of chiropractic care.\n\nDecrease in Pain\n\nWhen the nerves are correctly aligned, they receive less pressure, and the muscles work in a balanced way. This increases movement and decreases alarm signals from the body. Also, pain receptors are blocked by movement receptors, so more movement = less pain.\n\nMore Energy\n\nWith everything lined up and well connected, the body is not fighting itself, and there is more free energy to do the things we enjoy.\n\nFaster Recovery from Injuries\n\nWhen the body does not have to heal many things at once, there is more energy available to heal acute injuries. Many athletes report that they take less time to recover from their injuries.\n\nFewer Muscle Contractures\n\nContinued bad postures, or bad gestures, make the body adapt as best it can, always following the rule of protecting the most important thing: the nervous system and the viscera that keep us alive. Contractures occur because the structure is not stable enough, they are a reflection of the body to prevent further damage. The correct alignment predisposes stability and decreases contractures.\n\nBetter Posture\n\nMost people report that when under chiropractic care they find it easier to maintain good posture. When the structure (the skull, spine, pelvis, and bones) are not aligned, the muscles have to support us against the force of gravity. With so many things misaligned, comes a war of muscles and contractures that fatigue and tire causing discomfort in any position (standing, sleeping, sitting). The opposite situation occurs when everything is working together and correctly.\n\nFewer Sick Days\n\nWhen there is less\n interference in nerve communication, the body is easily maintained in homeostasis (balance). It increases the functioning of the immune system, and the body stays stronger against external invaders. Many studies show that people in chiropractic care miss fewer days from work and children fewer days from school.…\n\nREAD MORE\n\nPOSTED ON 2021-03-05\n\n By Julien Owery  0\nTips on Improving Gut Health\n\nYour gut health depends on what you eat and your lifestyle. Since slightly more than half of your immune system is found in your gut, you need to be watchful of what you eat and how you eat it. Numerous researchers over the years have shown that poor gut health can result in many health complications and thus advise you to keep your digestive system healthy. Fortunately, you can use Bio Complete 3, an effective supplement for ensuring a healthy gut.\n\nBelow are some of the ways to maintain your gut health:\n\nReduce Added Sugars and Processed Foods\n\nAdded sugars and processed foods taken in high amounts automatically decrease the good bacteria in your gut. The more of you take them, the more your body craves them and the more damage they will cause.\n\nIt would be best to choose natural sugars those in fruits and vegetables, and with time your body will adjust. When consuming a diet high in added sugars and processed foods, you put your gut at risk and stand the risk of suffering from excess weight and diseases including cancer.\n\nEat Foods Rich in Fiber\n\nFiber aids in digestion by facilitating the smooth flow of food through the tract to ensure no clogging or constipation. Besides, fiber helps to keep at bay digestive problems like irritable bowel syndrome. Moreover, eating more vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and fruits is a sure way to ensure your body has a sufficient supply of fibers.\n\nExercise Regularly\n\nFast heart pumping and sweating are healthy for your microbiome, because research shows inactive people have a poor microbiome. This shows in as much as you watch you eat, it is essential to exercise. Workouts increase your metabolism rate and hence fasten digestion.\n\nYou need not work out as a career sportsperson to achieve physical health. Simple jog around your neighborhood, visits to the gym, skipping, cycling dancing for roughly 150 minutes or more per week will do the trick.\n\nRelax and Avoid Stress\n\nStress doesn’t just affect your physical and mental health but the gut as well. Your microbiome influences other body organs too, which include the brain. The gut microbes affect the stress levels and mood hormones. Challenging situations are inevitable, but you can deal with them by taking one thing at a time and letting go of what you have no control of. If you have extreme difficulties in controlling stress, you can do some exercises to relieve your body from the pressure. Take a nature walk, meditate or do some breathing exercises.…\n\nREAD MORE\n\nPOSTED ON 2021-03-03\n\n By Fred Laird  0\nVarious Causes of Obesity\n\nUnhealthy weight gain can be caused by several factors, including hereditary factors,social-economic factors, and lifestyle. Obesity can lead to severe medical problems like diabetes, heart conditions, depression, and others. Trying to shed the excess pound may sometimes be futile and discouraging. Luckily, those looking to lose weight can use weight loss supplements like biofit. It helps you lose pounds without necessarily working out. It is ideal for you to have a busy schedule that does not allow you enough time to workout. Or if you have been on a diet and have not seen any visible results.\n\nBelow are some of the cause of obesity :\n\nAging\n\nObesity has no age limit, and even young children can be overweight. However, older people are more likely to be obese. This is because your body is undergoing some hormonal changes, and you are less active than you were when you were much younger. Your muscle mass also reduces with age, and the fewer muscles you have, the lower your metabolism, which means more fats will be stored than consumed. It is best to watch what you eat as you start aging than ever before to avoid\nobesity.\n\nInadequate Sleep\n\nToo much sleep or less of it can both cause obesity. When you do not get enough sleep, your body is sluggish and craves calories. This may cause you to crave more calories with less inactivity. When your body lacks energy, you may not be able to work out or be active as you should.\n\nStress\n\nWhen you are under stress, your body releases cortisol. This is a hormone that levels the stress hormone in your body. Even though cortisol is essential in balancing pressure in your body, it is detrimental to your weight. Cortisol works by suppressing all other activities, including the digestive system in your body. This means that as long as you are under stress, your metabolism level will lower hence fewer calories will be burned and thus a possibility of weight\ngain.\n\nPoor Feeding Habits\n\nOne of the leading causes of obesity in America and the world today is a poor diet. Most people have a busy schedule that does allow them time to shop and prepare healthy meals, and thus, they tend to eat takeouts. Takeouts are convenient and affordable, but they contain saturated sugars, fats and are high in salt and sodium. A daily diet with this kind of content is an automatic weight gain recipe. If your diet is high in sugars, unhealthy fats, salts, and sodium. It may be impossible to lose weight regardless of how many workouts you put in daily.…\n\nREAD MORE\n\nPOSTED ON 2021-03-03\n\n By Julien Owery  0\nTips on Managing Cholesterol on Body\n\nThe liver makes cholesterol to be used in many important functions in the body.

Managing cholesterol in the body can be done by altering your diet and taking supplements available. Here are tips on managing cholesterol in the body:\n\nFocus On the Healthy Fats\n\nA diet containing monounsaturated fats is good for weight loss and reduced levels of harmful LDL. Monounsaturated fat can reduce the oxidation of lipoproteins which leads to clogged arteries. Some sources of monounsaturated fats are; olive oil, avocado, almonds, canola oil, walnuts, cashew nuts, hazelnuts, and olives.\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids are the type of polyunsaturated fat that is mainly found in seafood and is beneficial in the human body. Avoid foods that contain hydrogenated fats or trans fats, they increase the cholesterol levels in the body.\n\n \n\nExercise Regularly\n\nExercising regularly has so many benefits including weight loss and improving the general physical fitness of a person. Aerobic activities are meant to increase the heart rate by 75% and resistance training should be 50% of the maximum effort. The longer the duration of your training the greater the benefits. Any activities that get the heart rate to 85% increase the HDL levels and decrease LDL.\n\nAim to at least two and half hours of physical exercise in a week. You don’t need to go to the gym you can walk for a few kilometers, go for a swim or start with yoga. If you as overweight focus on exercises that will help you reduce weight and generally cut fat. Exercising and proper dieting is the best way for fast weight loss.\n\nEat Soluble Fiber\n\nSoluble fiber is found in plants and dissolves in water because humans can’t digest them. Fiber is commonly known to help in digestive health but it can also aid in improving cardiovascular health.\n\nFoods rich in soluble fiber grabs cholesterol in the gut before it enters the bloodstream and lowers the bad cholesterol levels. Foods rich in soluble fiber include; chickpeas, lentils, kidney peas, quinoa, barley, oats, whole-grain bread, etc. You can also use fiber supplements like psyllium which is safe, cheap, and serves the same purpose as food.\n\nQuit Smoking\n\nYou risk getting several heart diseases when you smoke, it changes how your body handles cholesterol. Most smoker’s immune cells fail to return cholesterol from the vessel wall to the blood for transport to the liver. The immune cells will therefore become dysfunctional and contribute to the development of clogged arteries.\n\nMeanwhile, a study was done in Pacific Asia, smoking was linked to decreased HDL levels and increased total cholesterol. In smokers the only way to maintain cholesterol levels is to quit, it also reverses the harmful effects of smoking. Within three months to one year of quitting smoking your lung function and blood circulation will improve immensely.

Ways you can achieve this include the following;\n\nDiluting the Urine Sample\n\nIt means the urine sample contains a high amount of water content than the average amount.

The most common way of dilution that people use is an addition of pure water directly to their urine sample.\n\nSubstituting the Urine\n\nIt is the only method of beating a drug test with a consistent rate of success. It happens when the person going for the urine test submits urine that does is not his or hers. One way to do this is by purchasing one of the best synthetic urine like xstream synthetic urine and submitting instead of yours. Other techniques include the use of synthetic urine, liquid urine, and urine from another person. The challenge to these methods is maintaining the urine at the required temperature.\n\nAdulterating the Sample\n\nAn adulterated sample or specimen refers to a tampered urine sample. The tampering is achieved by the addition of certain chemicals to the urine sample. The substances will either interfere with the laboratory equipment used for test or mask the presence of drugs. However, the added compounds are easily detected, leading to the specimen being flagged as tainted.…\n\nREAD MORE\n\nPOSTED ON 2020-11-27\n\n By Fred Laird  0\nCommon Sleep Disorders and the Best Way to Overcome Them\n\nQuality sleep is essential for a healthy lifestyle.

Zeolite is also very effective in removing radiation, as proved during the Chernobyl nuclear disaster cleanup. Participants showed a 30% reduction in radioactive isotopes after the very first application of Zeolite! An ongoing intake shows increased benefits.\n\nThe actual Clinoptilolite Zeolite molecule is shaped like a honey-comb and carries a natural negative  charge. When this type of Zeolite is ingested into body, all positively  charged heavy metals, toxins, and harmful chemicals bind with the Zeolite.\n\n\nPatent No.: US 6,287,576 B1\n\nThrough laboratory testing and medical research, we were awarded a patent for the use of a zeolite with various biologically active vegetable stock additives. In virtue of this unique mix, the body’s reaction will help you overcome all sorts of ailments and diseases.\n\nZeolite (clinoptilolite) is a natural mineral known for its high effectiveness to adsorb low-weight molecules, specifically radioactive elements and heavy metals.\n \nZeolite dietary supplements by MineralMedix are formulated to adsorb harmful environmental pollutants that may have entered your body with drinking water or food.\n \nIt is important that Zeolite adsorbs small molecules only, sparing proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and vitamins – all of which are beneficial and essential nutrients for us.\n \nZeolite series by MineralMedix includes supplements enriched with herbal ingredients to enhance the cleansing process and to strengthen your body: Zeolite for Sport, Zeolite and Immune Support, Zeolite and Cardiovascular Support, and Pure Zeolite. Each are specifically adjusted to individual needs.\n \nAbsorbs Toxins\n\nDue to Zeolite’s extraordinary adsorption and selection capabilities, Zeolite binds with waste products and toxins.\n\nReleases Radicals and Metals from Your Body\n\nMost importantly, Zeolite binds with harmful heavy metals, allowing these substances to be easily eliminated from the body.\n\nBoosts the Immune System\n\nDue to the alkaline properties of Zeolite, the body’s alkalinity can be increased and pH levels can be properly regulated.\n\nImproves Your Body Mineral & Salt Balance\n\nZeolite is a unique antioxidant which is able to stabilize and regulate your immune system.\n\nNatural Siberian Product\nA UNIQUE DEPOSIT OF ZEOLITE\n\nZeolite is an important mineral used for many purposes. There are several deposits of this mineral in the world, but the only Zeolite deposit suitable for nutritional purposes is found in Siberia.\n\n \nWhy Zeolite is great\n\nOur Zeolite line includes breakthrough products with all-natural ingredients which have been proven to remove toxins, free radicals, and heavy metals from your body, act as an antiviral, balance the pH in the body, boost the immune system and cure many other symptoms.\n\n100%\nSafe\n\nZeolite is also very effective in removing radiation, as it was proven during the Chernobyl nuclear disaster cleanup.\n\n100%\nEffective\n\nParticipants showed a 30% reduction of radioactive isotopes after the very first application of Zeolite!\n\n100%\nNatural\n\nOur products contain only the purest natural minerals and supplements.\n\nSome facts about Zeolite:\nThe combination of toxin absorption and antioxidants makes Zeolite a powerful new tool in the human body cleansing\nZeolite comes in three forms: powder, pills, and liquid—all safe for human consumption\nIndividuals taking Zeolite reported to have more energy, better skin, fewer colds, joint pain relief, improved digestion, a stronger immune system, and more!\nZeolite has been used in Asia as a health tonic for more than 800 years!\n\nExpressed opinions about Zeolite\n\nTatyana Lubova\n    \n\nA few weeks ago I ordered Liver Guard and Kidney Guard, as soon as I placed my order I realized I made a mistake in my error.

Through technology, we develop scientifically proven, energy-enhanced products and services that promote optimal balance and personal well-being. We deliver these pioneering products and services for businesses, practitioners, and people.\n\n​SUPPLEMENTS TO SUPPORT YOUR ENERGY FIELD\n\nIn the 21st century, many physicians would agree that the human body is a matrix of interacting multidimensional energy fields, and maintaining the balance of energy movement within and between these fields is crucial to prevent illness or disease. ETI’s energy formulas help your body to achieve a state of unity between your mind, body, and spirit, resetting your energetic system, thereby increasing your energy levels, and aiding in the body’s self-recovery process.\n\nWHAT HEALTH PROFESSIONALS SAY\n\n“After reviewing all of these patient’s results, whether chronic-degenerative, intermediate or acute, it is most interesting that the Energy Tools International formulas have an influence across the board, and regardless of the category or condition, we observed consistent positive responses.”\n\n​\n\n-  Jeffrey L. Marrongelle, DC, CCN.\n\n“I have found Energy Tools International products to be the most unique, most creative and most powerful bio-energy products I have ever worked with. Using these products provide the energetic fuel that gets the body moving in the right direction.”\n\n​\n\n- Steven C. Davis DC, CTN, NMD\n\nAPPLY FOR PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNT\nOUR RESEARCH\n\nOver the last 25 years ETI created a unique and extensive library of energy formulas. Many of these patterns have been tested on humans, animals, plants, the health of cells and even on gene activity, showing a strong positive effect.\n\n​\n\nStress Relief Formula\n\nEMF Transformer\n\nClean Sweep Formula\n\n​\n\nDr. Yury Kronn (2014 - 2021), founder of Energy Tools International and inventor of VFT technology, has said, “obviously, we will not have clinical research on subtle energy effects until the mainstream scientific community recognizes the necessity to do it. Creative practitioners of energy medicine achieved remarkable results in using energy medicine tools separately and/or in combination with other healing modalities.”\n\nQUICK LINKS\nView Cart\nOrder Status\nVFT Technology Website\nRetail Website\nABOUT US\n\n​\n\nContact Us\n\nTerms/Conditions\n\nShipping Policy\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nReturns/Exchanges\n\nCONTACT US\n\nEmail: info@energytoolsint.com\n\nPhone: 1-800-341-7458\n\n\nAddress: Central Point, OR 97502\n\nFOLLOW US\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nDisclaimer: These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Cannabinoids are one class of compounds synthesized by Cannabis, however, the Cannabis sativa plant is an inefficient biological factory for even the most prevalent compounds such as THC and CBD, which comprise only 2-5% of the biomass of the plant. Cannabis is even less efficient at synthesizing the 100+ minor cannabinoids such as CBC, CBN and CBDV that typically comprise less than 0.1% of plant biomass.\n\nThe BayMedica platform solves this issue by engineering common yeast to convert sugar into cannabinoids, including common and rare natural varieties, as well as novel cannabinoid analogs of pharmaceutical interest. Our platform produces rare, non-intoxicating, naturally-occurring cannabinoids and novel cannabinoid analogs. We also leverage our experience in synthetic chemistry where applicable. BayMedica cannabinoids have a wide variety of applications in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, consumer and animal health industries.\n\nABOUT OUR PLATFORM\n\n.\n\nBayMedica Is A Subsidiary of InMed Pharmaceuticals\n\nInMed is a global leader in the manufacturing and development of rare cannabinoids. InMed is a clinical-stage company developing a pipeline of rare cannabinoid therapeutics and dedicated to delivering new treatment alternatives to patients that may benefit from cannabinoid-based pharmaceutical drugs.

Our expertise in coating can offer the following possibilities for your product:\nGI targeting (gastroresistance, release in the colon)\nProtective coatings (taste and odour masking, protect against moisture)\nElegant appearance with a colour coating of choice\nOur coating system allows us to film/enteric coat tablets, softgel capsules, two piece hard gelatin capsules or two piece vegetarian capsules.  We can colour coat your product to match an existing product colour or develop a new colour to your specifications.\nEncapsulation\nWe are industry leaders in encapsulation with the ability to produce over 10 million capsules per day. We have all new high speed fully automatic as well as semi-automatic capsules fillers to do both large and small runs. Our extensive capsule filling equipment allows us to produce capsule sizes #4, #3, #2, #1, “0” and “00”. We can offer a choice of colour or have your logo printed on the capsule. Capsules are available in vegetarian, bovine gelatin or porcine gelatin, and Halal and Kosher certified if required. Two piece hard gelatin or vegetarian capsules are the preferred and most common solid dosage form in the nutraceutical industry, because they have some advantages. Two-piece capsules are preferred by consumers, get products to market faster and use less excipients.\nTableting\n\nTablets comprise the largest group of delivery systems for all prescribed and over-the-counter (OTC) medications. Reasons for the popularity of tablets include the ease of accurate dosage and the good physical/chemical stability because of low moisture content, as well as the competitive unit production costs and the easily identifiable, elegant distinctive appearance.\n\nWe have the expertise and equipment to make almost any shape and size tablet you require. Some of the most common types of tablets we manufacture are:\n\nImmediate release, coated or uncoated\nModified release, coated or uncoated\nEffervescent (dissolved/suspended in water before drinking)\nChewable (chewed before swallowing)\n\nWe can custom design tablet tooling for specific shape or size along with company logo or product name embossed into the tablet.\n\nBlister Packaging & Cartoning\n\nWe have a high speed blister packaging line that can accommodate all of your blister packaging needs. Our online printer can print your logo, company name or anything else you require on the back of each blister pack. We can produce a custom blister card to your requirements with little lead time.\n\nOur high speed cartoner is capable of erecting the carton, inserting the blister card(s) or bottle, inserting a pamphlet, printing LOT/Exp, and sealing the carton at a speed of one every second. We can assist you in design and printing of the carton or just let us do it all.\n\nBottling & Labelling\nWe have three fully automatic high speed bottling lines that can accommodate any size or shape of bottle and/or cap. Our lines include bottle descrambling, high speed counting, dessicant dispenser, cotton inserter, capper, induction sealer, neckbander and automated shrink wrapper.\nPouching & Sachet Filling – Powder, Liquid, Capsules and Tablets\nWe have the ability to produce single serving pouches or sample packs with powder or multiple capsules or tablets in large or small volume. Our pouching equipment can accommodate a minimum pouch size of 63mm x 94 mm (2.5” x 3.75”) to a maximum size of 112mm x 150mm (4.5” x 6”). Our equipment has the versatility to pouch in a variety of material including foil, paper, and poly. We can liquid fill custom shaped sachets for easy single dose applications, such as cough syrup or energy gels.\nStick Packaging\nOur high-speed stick packaging equipment can produce over 800,000 sticks per day and accurately dose both pharmaceutical and nutraceutical powders. Stick packs are ideally suited for single dose applications from 0.5 grams to 10 grams, depending on material bulk density.\nFormulation\n\nTo consistently produce a product of high standard you must first begin with a Master Formula. A quality Master Formula may take extensive R&D to ensure the formulation meets all specifications. A correctly formulated Master formula ensures that the product: meets all product specifications (dosage, disintegration, stability, etc.), can run successfully on specific equipment, has an elegant appearance, can be readily duplicated.\n\nPNP Pharmaceuticals has the expertise to formulate most any dry dosage form, such as, capsule, tablet, and powder.  From the simple to the most complex formulations our experienced formulators can confidently fulfill your requirements.\n\nBlending\n\nThe blending stage is a critical area of production, for without a homogenous blend the finished product will not meet specifications. PNP Pharmaceuticals employees several blenders that are specifically designed and validated for different applications.  Our blending equipment includes:\n\nlarge ribbon blenders - with a maximum blend capacity of 1500kg (3300lb).\nlarge V-blenders - with a maximum blend capacity of 500kg (1100lb).\nsmall offset twin cone blender - with a maximum blend capacity of 100kg (220lb).\n\nAll blenders are custom manufactured from high quality stainless steel and meet or exceed all GMP requirements.\n\nCoating\nThe coating of a tablet, softgel or two piece hard gelatin capsule offers many advantages, such as a higher physiochemical stability, better compliance and increased therapeutic efficacy of the active ingredient.

This system reduces the chance of human error.\nThroughout the manufacturing process, our QA/QC personnel performs in-process sampling and in-house testing to ensure uniformity to our specifications. In-house testing may include but not limited to disintegration, hardness, friability, and weight variation. The product in bulk form is tested by third party laboratory according to applicable specifications. If all tests meet applicable specifications, the manufactured product is released for packaging or shipment in bulk.\nDuring the packaging phase, again our QA/QC personnel perform in-process sampling and testing (such as fill accuracy, integrity of seal, label verification, and correctness of lot number and expiry date) to ensure conformity to specifications. If all specifications are met the product will undergo finished product testing before being released for shipment.\nSite Licence (Can be provided upon request)\n\nUnder the NHPD regulations set forth by Health Canada all manufacturers of natural health products must have a valid Site Licence to fabricate and/or package nutritional products.

It is important to understand that a pharmaceutical company has many more costs associated with it than a nutriceutical organization. Often times a nutriceutical company will be able to produce a product exactly the same way with exactly the same equipment as a pharmaceutical organization by as much as half the cost. Much of what of what is charged to clients comes from overhead and a pharmaceutical manufacturer will have much more overhead than a company designed to produce herbs and vitamins alone.\nIs Avalon Packaging a wholesale capsule manufacturing company?\nWe are completely wholesale we do not sell anything to the public. All product information is held completely confidential and we protect our clients right to privacy in every way. Capsules are our specialty we have not had any other organization bid below us. If they happen to we guarantee we can give you a new bid that will put us back into position to encapsulate. We are so confident of this that we will beat the best price by a minimum of 10%.\nWho should I have encapsulate my product?\nWhen deciding which encapsulator to use you want to look at many things. Does the company get inspected by a third party? Do you feel confident that they will produce your product to the highest standards. Let me assure you some vitamin manufacturing organizations are much better equiped and can give you quality assurance and a faster turnaround time than competing capsule and vitamin servicers.\nAre some vitamin manufacturers better than others?\nEncapsulation companies vary in standards even though all third party inspected companies are GMP certified. In larger companies when mistakes are made key personel get laid off. At Avalon Packaging we learn from our mistakes rather than letting key personel go we train them and they become more proficient.\nCONTACT US FOR A QUOTE TODAY!\n\nWE PROMISE YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!\n\nSCOTT BARCLAY, OWNER\n\nPHONE: 801-318-0328\n\nEMAIL: SCOTTABARCLAY@GMAIL.COM\n\nCopyright (c) 2021 Avalon Packaging.

Whether seasonal or as a long-term investment, you are unsure where to start. Choosing the right company is a crucial part of your success. You may have many questions regarding the process, packaging options, capacity, and turnaround. So you need to talk to someone with the right expertise and someone you can be sure you can trust. Look for a 3PL company that provides a consultative, personalized approach. A packaging company that will make the entire process easy to understand. \n\nPartnership with a third-party company should be backed by excellent communication throughout the entire process, from initial consultation to delivery, to help your business thrive. Having an open line of communication will also make it easier to implement any changes, address potential problems, and avoid the typical issues that arise from misunderstandings and a general lack of communication.\n\nConsider the benefits you can gain by working with an order fulfillment company. Do you need assistance with package design? What is your production capacity? How much support do you need? What warehouse solutions are you interested in? Are certifications required? Think about lead times and finances. The right company can help maximize efficiency in most aspects of the process\n\nBlister Packing\nBagging\nAssembly\nGluing\nShrink Wrapping\nFulfillment\nKitting\nThe DMS Consultative Approach\n\nOur customers range in size from some of the world’s largest printers and marketing companies to small companies requiring specialized services.

We work together to deliver great packaging solutions.  Our flexibility makes us well-suited for projects of all sizes and types. We can find the right gluing solutions for any material, including paper, corrugate, wood, plastics, and metals, whether your project requires assembling and gluing a display, affixing a card or P.I. to a brochure, or simply gluing together a marketing piece.\n\n \n\nOur primary focus is competitive pricing, quick turnaround, and dedication to your requirements. DMS Packaging provides a consultative approach to innovative end-to-end packaging solutions. This is accomplished through an “easy to understand” program of simplifying and managing your packaging requirements. At DMS Packaging, we help maximize the process’s efficiency by helping you decide what type of packaging is best for you, cartons, blister packs, shrink wrapping, bags, or boxes. The items mentioned above can be customized to suit your requirements and unique needs. We will review timelines, designs, product sizes, costs, and specifications. \n\nCONTACT US TO DISCUSS YOUR PROJECT\nServices\n\nAssembly\nBagging\nBlister Packing\nFulfillment\nGluing\nKitting\nShrink Wrapping \n\nBlog\nContact Us Today\n\nPhone: (847)907-3700\n\nEmail: Info@dmspack.com\n\n1201 Mark St\nElk Grove Village, IL 60007\n\nFollow Us"

Nothing is imported.\n\nPremium CBD Hemp Flower You Can Trust\n\nWe go to great lengths to ensure the products your get from us are the best flower products you have every tried. If you any reason you are every unsatisfied with your order, just let us know. Contact us here.\n\nWhat Exactly Is Hemp Flower?\n\nHemp Flower (also known as CBD flower, CBD bud) is one of the most used parts of the hemp plant. Its the “bud” of the plant. It’s used to make high-end CBD oils, hemp oil, and of course, smokable hemp flower products. These days hemp strains are grown just like THC cannabis strains and look just like them as well. The only real difference in hemp flower and cannabis flower, is the delta 9 THC content. Hemp flower has basically none, while cannabis can be as high as 35%.\n\nWhat Is Smoking Hemp Flower Like?\n\nIt’s a lot like smoking the “real” stuff. Except you won’t get that old familiar feeling. There is a lot more then just THC going on with hemp flower, you will feel the effects and benefits of everything the plant has to offer, without that. It is important to mention that smoking CBD flower isn’t going to be the absolute best method for consuming CBD flower…simply because of the unhealthiness of inhaling smoke. Smoking hemp flower should be especially avoided by those with respiratory issues, minors, or seniors that have been advised against smoke inhalation.\n\nHow Much CBD Is In Hemp Flower?\n\nEach hemp strain has unique characteristics, including CBD levels. Most strains on our site will have between 10% and 25% CBD content. CBD levels are a great way to gauge different strains, but it’s not always just about which strain is testing the highest. You might enjoy an indoor grow with 12% CBD over an outdoor 25% CBD content strain. A little bit of sampling is always a good idea!\n\nHow Much THC Content Is In Hemp Flower?\n\nUnder the 2008 Farm Bill hemp flower is federally legal as long as it contains less than .3% delta-9 THC. All the hemp flower on our site meets these requirements.\n\nWhat Products are Made From CBD Flower?\n\nWe have many premium hemp products to choose from at Mr. Hemp Flower including full spectrum cbd gummies, CBG flower, CBD topicals, CBD joints and pre rolls, CBD kief, and even moon rocks.Now, we even make delta 8 THC products from CBD flower. Including Delta 8 THC Gummies, Pre Rolls, Vapes, and more.\n\nDelta 9 Gummies\n\nMr. Hemp Flower is excited to bring you our new hemp-derived Delta-9 THC full-spectrum gummies. These delicious gummies are packed with 10 mg of premium delta-9 THC extract each. They have the perfect, juicy, and chewy texture you want in a gummy and taste great!

By constantly adding innovative SKUs with new-to-market ingredients, tweaking formulas for rapid growth in targeted categories, and providing stock programs for custom products, we’re helping customers rapidly expand and increase sales.\n\nOur Products\n\nThe medical doctors at M&M Labs are experts in nutraceutical and cosmetic formulation, constantly scouring the latest research on ingredient efficacy. For nutraceuticals, Dr.Hendricks is on the front line of ingredient innovation, developing new ingredients like algae-based EPA products. For cosmetics, Dr. Hendricks develops cutting-edge ingredients and leverages products with clinical research and published clinical trials.\n\nNutraceuticals\n\nCapsules\nTablets\nGummies\nPowders\nLiquids\nAnd More\n\nCosmetics\n\nSerums\nCreams\nSprays\nMoisturizers\nBalms\nAnd More\n\nBioBottles™\n\nThe Future of Plastic!\nBiodegradable Plastic Bottles\nEnvironmentally Responsible\nPlastic IQ™ Technology\n100% Recyclable\nFDA and Food-Grade Compliant\n\n Here’s what our customers are saying. \n\n“There are many health supplement contract manufacturing companies in the United States. The concern in selecting a contract manufacturer is vital for several reasons. First and foremost, is trust (which I believe to be synonymous with consistent quality, the first time and every time) followed by price, and on time delivery. Dr. Jeffrey Hendricks does project this level of confidence when you speak with him. Moreover, Dr. Hendricks has adopted a keen sense of awareness as a manufacturing partner. He has taken the time to understand our business and has become a value-added business partner!”\n\nVita Miracle\n\n“It is not an exaggeration to say that working with Samantha and the team at M&M has fundamentally changed my business for the better. Prior to moving my business under the M&M umbrella several years ago, we struggled with missed deadlines, poor communication from our factory partners and requests that were often misunderstood or outright ignored. All of that stopped the minute Samantha took over handling our production needs. Day or night, weekends and holidays, she always answers her phone to provide an update or make sure a project is on track and even better she is a true advocate for our business and products. I not only consider her a key business partner, but also now a close friend. \n\nThe rest of the team including Dr. Hendricks and Steven King similarly are readily available to help when needed and always look out for our best interests. Dr. Hendricks has been fantastic at assisting with product development and formulation and has helped guide us when launching new products. I could not recommend working with M&M more and I am grateful that I was introduced to them.”\n\nVB HEALTH\n\nM&M do an amazing job at creating all of our products, and I can say without question after dealing with many other manufacturers: THESE GUYS ARE THE VERY BEST! We are blessed to have them, and we couldn’t do what we do without their help. Dr Hendricks is an M.D. and also a genius – he knows so much about the science behind what goes into supplements and how they really work. His expertise and experience helps M&M bring so much more to the table than anyone else out there. They are also a pleasure to work with at every stage of product development, and on top of all that, they also help us with warehousing, fulfilment and essentially everything having to do with our products. M&M ROCKS!  Sorry guys, don’t mean to make you blush! But seriously, you guys are the BEST! I really do not miss the days of pulling my hair out from dealing with other sub-par manufacturers!\n\nOMNIBIOTICS\n\nQuick Links\n\nAbout\nProcess\nServices\nContact\n\nM&M Labs LLC\n\n877-366-5227\n\nLocations\n\n4021 Highway 108E, Mill Spring, NC 28756\n1000 E Rutherford St, Landrum, SC 29356\n\n \n\n© 2021 M&M Labs USA.

So I recently bought, got it a few days ago and use it to wash my face 2x a day and all my pimples. Literally all. Have disappeared and the red pigmentation of my skin is starting to fade. This stuff is magical. Just break it up into smaller chunks and put in a bag and use some at a time.\n\nBrila / Walmart\n\nThis soap seems to be good quality and it always leaves my skin feeling super clean. I would recommend if you have sensitive skin or prefer more natural products.\n\nIsabel / Amazon\n\nThis shea butter is great on my skin! I have been using it on my dry elbows and knees, and it has been doing a good job of keeping them smooth and supple. It is smoother than most shea butters and has no scent, which I like because scents make me feel ill. I will be ordering this product again.\n\nsharonluella / Amazon\n651N Highway 183 #335 PMB 3012 Leander United States\nProducts\nNatural Body Butters\nAfrican Black Soaps\nEssential Natural Oils\nOrganic Powders\nCutomer service\nPayments\nShipping & delivery\nPrivacy Policy\nSupport\nContact\nAbout us\nApply For Wholesale\nBlog\nFAQ\nTERMS PRIVACY COOKIES\n----------------------------------------------------\nCopyright 2025 © Churchwin LLC\nThis site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.

We take pride in pioneering the \"Atomic Particle Extraction Process,\" revolutionizing the world of colloidal silver production.\nOur groundbreaking method securely bonds precious metal atoms such as Gold, Silver, Copper, Platinum, and more, essential for crafting trace mineral colloidal silver. What sets us apart is our ability to consistently produce atomic silver particles, marking a significant advancement over traditional methods. We strictly adhere to FDA guidelines for dietary supplements to ensure your safety and satisfaction.\nBUY TRACE MINERAL\n\n COLLOIDAL SILVER\nBUY TRACE MINERAL COLLOIDAL PRODUCTS\nWelcome to GoldenGevity, the pioneers of the world's first \"Atomic Particle Extraction Process.\" In our context, \"atomic\" refers to the size and form of the particles. This unique process consistently creates atomic-sized particles of elements, which means we are on the threshold of a new era of truly perfected products across multiple industries.\n\nGoldenGevity will revolutionize technology, material and health sciences. GoldenGevity has always maintained the reasoning that if modern medicine can incorporate the \"Atomic Particle Size\" into their products, their products may bring more amazing results, with near ZERO side effects (unless you are allergic to silver, or other elements).\n\nGoldenGevity currently markets immune and metabolic support products for health optimization.\n\n\n\nThe human body is composed of a wide array of elements found on Earth. Consequently, a deficiency in the trace minerals we are naturally endowed with can lead to chemical imbalances that may disrupt bodily functions and create long-term adverse health conditions.\n\nCertain elements possess antiviral and antibacterial properties and are known to enhance the immune system. Others play a crucial role in maintaining chemical equilibrium. Some elements have anti-aging effects, with one in particular reported to correct defective DNA. While many of these elements are already utilized in pharmaceutical products, their efficacy is often limited due to their production in nanoparticle sizes, which also leads to toxic side effects.\n\nAt GoldenGevity, we are at the forefront of providing perfected colloidal silver, gold, and unique blends of trace mineral noble metal solutions that enhance and perfect overall metabolic health and support and optimize the immune system.\n\nOur \"Atomic Particle Extraction Process\" is not just a game-changer but a disruptor, transforming the colloidal silver and gold industry, rendering previous methods obsolete while debunking competitors' erroneous claims. We are setting a new standard in the industry.\n\nGoldenGevity's Atomic Particle Extraction process bonds atoms of precious metals like gold, silver, copper, and platinum to water molecules and produces particle sizes that are 0.1nm. In their atomic state and particle size, these metals are no longer metallic but are crystal-like atoms of the employed elements.\n\nGoldenGevity's atomic-sized particles have the potential to revolutionize and elevate pharmaceutical products and various other industries. For decades, toxic nanoparticles were the only available option, posing risks of internal organ damage and offering temporary fixes rather than true solutions. But now, there's a safer, more effective alternative. \n\nAtomic particles will pave the way for smaller electronics, perfected nanorobot technology, superior immune support for livestock, enhanced immune support for agricultural products, and many quantum applications.\n\nGoldenGevity is gaining worldwide attention as we introduce the Atomic Particle Extraction Process, poised to elevate science to the next level of perfection! \n\n\nUnmatched Purity: Our atomic colloidal silver particles, a mere 0.1 nanometers in size, are incredibly pure and perfect for consumption.\n​\nPerfected Immune Support: The high concentration of atomic colloidal silver which can range from 2000 to 12,000 PPM effectively supports your immune system, helping you stay healthy.\n​\nExcellent Bioavailability:  The particles are very easy for the body to assimilate and expel due to their impeccable atomic size, that is impossible for them to accumulate and create long term toxicity.\n \n​Non-Toxic: Silver, Gold, or other noble metals in the atomic state are no longer metallic, but are crystalline in nature, the ideal particle type the body likes and utilizes to slow down the again process as well as perfect the metabolism.\n \nNo Chemicals or Herbal Catalysts:  No gimmicky chemicals or Herbal extracts are ever used before, during or after the production process. An accomplishment no other company can claim, especially in High PPM concentrations.\n \nImperceptible Nature: These tiny particles are invisible to the naked eye, and the solutions are clear as water, making them a safer alternative to larger nanoparticles that have been proven to be toxic and create long-term side effects.\n​​​\nImpeccable Effectiveness: Our atomic colloidal silver is more potent and efficient, delivering optimal results for your well-being, much faster than other well known companies.\nNo other company can match GoldenGevity's particles size, nor High PPM capabilities!\nBUY TRACE MINERAL\n\n Silver, Copper & Zinc\nBUY TRACE MINERAL\n\n Gold 2000 - 4000 PPM\nBUY TRACE MINERAL\n\n CANCLEANSE\nBUY HIGH PPM PRODUCTS\nAtomic Particle Size Colloidal Silver and Premium Trace Minerals \nSupercharge your wellness journey with Non-Toxic  True Colloidal Silver Trace Minerals​​​\nOffering some of the most concentrated and advanced formulations to support overall wellness, metabolism, and cellular health!\n\nTo the right is an image by Brookhaven National Laboratory that captured its first image of a gold atom on January 31, 2023.\n\n\n\nThis image was taken using the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), which accelerates gold ions to nearly the speed of light to observe their interactions and internal structures at a quantum level.\n\nGet Your Life Back!\n Get Your Peace Back!\nGet Your Health Back!\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding What Type of Colloidal Silver is Toxic.\n​\n\nGoldenGevity's Atomic Particle Colloidal Silver, earn Why it outperforms all others.​​\n\n\nMonatomic Atomic Particle Colloidal Gold, the True Anti-Aging Elixier.\n​\n\n​​LifeGevity, Monatomic Elements of Gold, Iridium, Platinum, Rhodium and Ruthenium - The True Elixer of Life\n\n\nBUY TRACE MINERAL\n\n COLLOIDAL SILVER\nOffice Hours (PST):\n\nMonday- Friday\n​9:00 am- 4:00pm​\n\n\n\nEmail:  info@truecolloidal.com\n\n\n\n\n*The statements have not been evaluated by the United States Food and Drug Administration and are not approved to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent disease.\nYou should always consult with a healthcare professional before starting the use of Colloidal Silver or any diet or supplementation program.

Thank you for your hard work on those!\"\n\n- Melissa L. - Marketing\n\n\"Your company has been very responsive and working with Sonic has been great. We will definitely keep you on the list and hopefully will do business together in the near future.\"\n\n- Alex S. - General Manager\n\n\"After weeks of speaking with about a dozen co-packers, we've narrowed our choice to 2 companies --Sonic and one other in the same general region. You personally have a lot to do with Sonic's ending up at the top... We'd be happy and confident to engage with you!\"\n\n- Bruce W\n\n\"Thanks to Sonic Packaging for taking out BOOST® Fertilizer Dispenser Box design and making it a reality! When I came into my office and saw the sample on my desk my co-workers enjoyed seeing my happy reaction to the result! Having never designed in 3D before, I was nervous about the finished product. Not only did Sonic produce sample packets, they produced the dispenser box too. We anticipate a quick re-order and will call Sonic again.\"\n\n- Sally A. Murdock\n\n\"Your patience always makes my problems seem a lot smaller. You have always come through even when our expectations seem impossible to meet (which is all the time). I consider myself very lucky to work together with such a wonderful company and a great team of people.\"\n\n- Grisel R. - Product Analyst\n\n\"Sonic's service has been extremely vital for our operations. Meeting our timeline, while responding quickly to our many requests for changes, is very important to us. Sonic has consistently met our expectations and has helped us produce quality products.\"\n\n- Jacob K. - Planning/Product Development\n\n\"Not only has Sonic been a very valuable partner in the field of packaging innovation, helping us deliver our products in new and meaningful ways, but they also have an eye on controlling costs and delivering value.\"\n\n- Harry H\n\n\"As a longtime customer, Pedinol Pharmacal Inc. appreciates the personal customer attention provided by everyone at Sonic. It is always a pleasurable experience. They also keep us in the loop about new and innovative packaging available.\"\n\n- Marianne R. - Purchasing Manager\n\n\"We've been working with Sonic Packaging for over 10 years, and they have been extremely flexible, reliable, and responsive to our needs. What I admire most is that they offer the same quality of service regardless of your company size.\"\n\n- Kate M. - Senior Product Development Manager\n\n\"It has always been a pleasure working with the team at Sonic. They are always on the cutting edge of new product ideas and technology. If they can't do it, be assured it can't be done!\"\n\n- Chris C. - Manager of Contract Packaging\n\n\"Sonic was the last to receive the RFQ for this project but the first to submit your response. Not only did Sonic follow the instructions of the bid sheet perfectly, but they went above and beyond… supplying me with additional information that will be important to the project going forward. I like the way you do business…very professional.Great job Sonic!\"\n\n- Lauren P.\n\n\"I have been traveling and am in and out of the office again for the next two weeks but wanted to touch base and thank you for your effort, professionalism, and great attitude.\"\n\n- Peter D. - Project Manager\n\n\"Working with Sonic is wonderful because they are a one-stop shop! Reliable and resourceful!\"\n\n- Carmelita L.\n\n\"What can I say, Sonic is one of our best resources. Our company is in a time of rapid growth and samples are a big part of that. We are constantly reordering products from Sonic and they have served us well. We have gotten into many jams with our vendors not supplying us on time. Sonic has been able to fast-track these orders in a calm efficient way. Having them to rely on removes much of the stress in an already stressful situation.\"\n\n- Maurice M. - President\n\n\"I used separate vendors on these two products because this type of packaging is new to me and I wanted to try several companies out and to ensure we could get everything on time. Although your pricing was not the lowest, your communication and plant location was the determining factor with placing business with Sonic.\"\n\n- Mike N. - Sales Manager\n\n\"I've been sending our customers to Sonic Packaging. They have a lot of capabilities, their communication is great, and their quality is top-notch. They don't have the cheapest prices but that's for good reason given the values I just mentioned. Sonic will also handle the film and displays, which makes it super simple to purchase turnkey.\"\n\n- Brian B. -V.P. of Contract Manufacturing\n\n\"Tracey has been great to work with and provides great communication. Tracey is the best.\"\n\n- Brayton C.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\nContract Packaging & Filling Services\n\nAt Sonic we work as a team with common goals to create a positive experience\n\nfor our customers and valued partners.\n\nSonic is an industry-leading contract packaging manufacturer and product filling solutions provider serving medium to large manufacturing and brand marketing corporations within the diagnostics, pharmaceutical, medical device, nutrition, CBD, beauty, cosmetics, and animal health industries.

He saw a need in the nutrient additive marketplace and wanted to make an additive so good that it could be used as an All-In-One additive, consolidating multiple additives into one. After a lot of hard work he developed Golden Tree. The name made sense, because any tree that got a taste of it would turn to gold for the grower.\n\nSince Golden Tree, HSS has emerged as one of the major plant nutrient manufacturers and suppliers to hydroponic/agricultural distributors in the United States.

So some times that I had a hard time walking and would awake me at night to hobble to the kitchen to have a double chicken bouillon or an electrolyte drink...or both. Thirty minutes to an hour later the pain would subside. After taking this wonder product for 4 days now I’m most happy to say that not once have I cramped. Unreal. If you have these acute keto cramps, try this product - you’ve got a real good chance to find relief.\nThomas M.\n\nApril 22\nRead More\nI don't like drinking salt water. I don't like the processed sodium chloride, so this is the best and only option I have found. It is also vegan.\nMonk B\n\nApril 22\nRead More\nThis product has been a true blessing 🙏 This product has been a true blessing 🙏\nW.T Hoffman\n\nApril 22\nRead More\nThese are great for husband’s neurocardio syncope…when they arrive! Thea capsules were recommended by my husband’s neurologist for his neurocardio syncope as a supplement to the meds he already takes for it. And they have helped greatly.

It has all the best certifications.\n\n– J.L Direct Television\n\t\n12345\nSETTING THE BAR\n\nCustomer service is only half the equation. You can have the best customer service in the world, but if you can’t deliver a quality service and product, then you’re not truly serving your clients.\n\nInvaPharm has the facilities and qualified manpower to match its exceptional customer service and on-time delivery.\n\nWe have perfected our approach to product formulation, development, manufacturing, and packaging.

InvaPharm understands the need for science-based products, so we stay on the forefront of nutritional science and regulatory requirements.\nMANUFACTURING\n\nNot all dietary supplement manufacturers are the same. We have invested millions in building our state-of-the-art manufacturing facility and laboratory. This facility is designed specifically for pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and cosmetic products.

This is what we specialize in. Our product development services include pilot runs to ensure integrity of the formula and manufacturing steps. That means there’s no guess work. You’ll save money and have peace of mind.\nPACKAGING\nYears ago, it was exclusively plastic bottles. Today, you have options. Our packaging services let you select the packaging that makes the most sense for your brand. Choose from the highest quality bottles, jars, gusset bags, pouches, blister cards, sticks, tubes, and much more.\nLEARN MORE\nInvaPharm Is Prime Ready\n\nEveryone is on Amazon, but not everyone understands Amazon’s strict requirements.\n\nAmazon is known to penalize brands who do not adhere to their requirements.
