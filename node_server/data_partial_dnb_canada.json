During your visit, you will learn about the history behind our company's success, discover the values that inspire us, and the quality products we bring to market  that have established Central Bernard as an industry leader in North-America. Founded in 1962, Central Bernard's success is built on three fundamental principles:\n\n\nEmployees are treated with respect and are given the opportunity for growth.\nThe customer experience must be a fair and professional one.\n\nOur products must always exceed customer expectations in terms of quality, food safety and service.\n\nMission\nA CUSTOMER-DRIVEN FAMILY BUSINESS\n\nCentral Bernard is committed to providing uncompromising service to the most exacting customers. We believe in building long-term customer relationships based on our ability to process and supply the highest quality, value-added poultry products in a profitable and cost efficient manner. Being customer driven affords us the flexibility to meet the individual and changing needs of our clients.\n\n\nAs a custom processor of poultry products, Central Bernard has invested heavily in a state-of-the-art processing plant capable of servicing, promptly and efficiently, major supermarket chains in Canada with single or multi-pack poultry cuts, value-added products as well as private label brands.\nQuality\nA trusted source of quality poultry products, Central Bernard's HACCP and SQF accredited processing plant offers a temperature-controlled environment ideally suited for the safe manipulation of poultry products.\nOur facility houses a full time inspector from the CFIA (Canadian Food Inspection Agency) and meets or exceeds all food safety protocols and standards. Third-party audits performed by our main customers continue to regularly confirm the quality of our plant's environment.\nHACCP (Hazardous Analysis Critical Control Point) is a system in which food safety is addressed through the identification and management of risks and hazards known as CCPs (Critical Control Points) throughout our processes. SQF (Safe Quality Food) is a recognized total quality management system under the GFSI (Global Food Safety Initiative) umbrella that is used to apply and maintain quality standards throughout the entire supply chain.\nServices\nAt Central Bernard we find and provide solutions to meet our customers' needs and will go to great lengths to satisfy all special requests.\nFreshPRODUCTS(installations)\nA STATE-OF-THE-ART ADDED-VALUE PROCESSING FACILITY\nOpened in 2003, Central Bernard's 50,000 sq. ft federally inspected facility is both HACCP and SQF (Safe Quality Food) certified. It’s designed to efficiently process over 60,000 kilograms of tray packed product in a single shift. Incorporating the latest technology and leveraging the skills of our highly trained professionals has been the winning formula that has allowed Central Bernard to experience such rapid growth.\n‍\nCentral Bernard offers a wide selection of fresh chicken in a variety of cuts. Packed in bulk or in counter ready tray format, all cuts are processed in a temperature controlled environment that respects all HACCP and SQF food safety guidelines.\nCustomers\nOUR CUSTOMERS ARE OUR PARTNERS\n\n\nCentral Bernard supplies most major retail food chains in Eastern Canada with superior quality chicken cuts and value-added private-label products. The company strives to provide all its customers with the highest quality at the best possible price and has built its reputation on uncompromising and personalized customer service.\n\nOUR TEAM\nA TEAM OF HIGHLY SKILLED PROFESSIONALS\n\nAll members of our team have made the «chicken business\" their business. Each team member is extensively trained with an emphasis on food safety, therefore bringing added value to their work and ensuring the highest of quality standards.\n\nMANAGEMENT \nCentral Bernard's management team alone has over 150 years of meat and poultry related experience. Our empowered team is expected to actively participate in many aspects of our business in order to meet or exceed the needs of our customers.\n\nFOCUS\nWith a focus on retail chain production, our experienced team prides itself on its ability to continuously produce the quality products that Central Bernard's reputation has been built on. We combine the best of both worlds, using the latest equipment and processing techniques while maintaining the human component throughout our process.\n\n“Our people take great pride in the work they do and in our ability to meet or exceed our customers’ expectations.”\nCOMMITTED TOWARDS PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT\nCentral Bernard operates its processing plant in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner and is continuously striving to improve its processes to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. This is achieved through the integration within our production facility of water and energy saving equipment, high performance waste management techniques and the progressive elimination of CFC usage. Our willingness to reduce the carbon footprint of our facility has led us to invest heavily in a heat recovery system that recuperates the energy generated by the compressors of our refrigeration equipment to heat the water that is used to wash-down the plant on a daily basis.\n\nWe also offer our customers the option of converting to biodegradable tray packaging to further reduce the environmental impact of their products and comply with governmental policies and guidelines concerning the efficient use of resources.\n\nCONTACT US!\nCENTRAL BERNARD INC.\n\n2001, 32nd Avenue, Lachine, Québec H8T 3J1\n\nTel. : 514-780-8585\n\nToll-free : 1-877-956-9696\n\ninfo@centralbernard.com\n\nPlease feel free to contact us at any time for additional information on our products and services.\n"

Our seal means you’re getting the very best cup of decaf, free of chemicals or residual processing flavors. \n\nLearn More\nAll decaffeination processes are not created equal.\nThe Swiss Water® Process is certified organic and\nwe have always been committed to processing\nwithout added chemicals. \nMETHYLENE CHLORIDE\n\nA widely-used method of chemical solvent decaffeination uses Methylene Chloride, or dichloromethane, to remove caffeine particles from coffee. Unfortunately, it's not the safest substance, and has been banned in paint thinners and other industrial products for its toxicity. The use of Methylene Chloride as a decaffeination solvent is ages-old, but personally, we’d prefer to avoid even the smallest amount in what we consume.\n\nETHYL ACETATE, SUGARCANE, OR 'NATURAL' DECAFFEINATION\n\nAnother popular chemical solvent method is Ethyl Acetate, or acetylated ethyl alcohol. While it can be naturally derived, and is sometimes described as a natural process, at commercial scale, synthetic production is required. When used to decaffeinate, Ethyl Acetate changes the flavor of the coffee, adding a lingering fruity characteristic. We’d prefer our coffee to taste the way it was intended.\n\nCARBON DIOXIDE\n\nCarbon dioxide (or CO2) occurs naturally, but for commercial use is generally distilled from industrial byproduct. As a decaffeination medium, CO2 is used under pressure to improve its extractive properties. The CO2 process does not use chemical solvents.\n\nTAKE A COFFEE BREAK\nVisit Our Coffee Store for a Taste of the Best Roaster Selections\nShop Now\nCertifications\n\nOur process ensures coffee certifications remain intact, including Organic*—a promise chemical solvent processes can't make. Learn more about our certifications below.\n\n*OCIA certification is applicable only to non-roasted green coffee described on this site, unless otherwise specified.\n\nLatest on the Blog\nWOMEN'S COFFEE SELECTION | 04 DECEMBER 2024\nSmall Batch Series Rwanda Nyamyumba Women’s Coffee\nRead More \nOUR OFFERINGS | 25 OCTOBER 2024\nSmall Batch Series Nicaragua Elixir\nRead More \nOUR OFFERINGS | 19 NOVEMBER 2024\nSwiss Water Spot Coffee Offerings\nRead More \nAsk Us Anything\n\nQuestions?

      "textData": "QUALITY FIRST\n\nABOUT BOUVRY EXPORTS OUR MEATS COUNTRIES WE SERVE HORSE EID INFO ANIMAL WELFARE CONTACT US ENGLISH \nHigh-quality Canadian meats since 1982\n\nFor more than three decades, we have worked alongside restaurants, distributors and retailers, ensuring the highest food safety, animal welfare and employee safety throughout our supply chain. We take pride in the entire process, from the farmland, to the livestock, to the processing facilities. Because we raise our own animals as well as the crops they eat, we can provide unmatched quality.\n\nAs we strive to maintain our high standards and improve our processes, we continue to integrate our farms and feedlots so we can easily track our quality and supply from start to finish. It also allows us to maintain constant supply, so you never need to worry about backorders or long waits.\n\nThanks to our time in the industry, we have become a major player in the production and export of high quality Canadian meats, including bison, elk, horse and beef. Along with our sister company, Viande Richelieu, we own and operate two federally inspected facilities, one in southern Alberta, and the second in Quebec. By controlling the farmland, breeding, livestock, feed and processing of our animals, we ensure nothing but the highest quality across our entire operation.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nOur Meats\nBEEF\n\nOur beef is high-quality, from the cattle right down to the land they are raised on. We ensure that all cattle receive high protein feed to guarantee superb marbling in every cut. For more information about our Canada-raised beef, download our brochure.\n\nEU CERTIFIED HORMONE-FREE\nAGE VERIFIED\nGRADED ACCORDING TO STRICT CANADIAN STANDARDS\nBISON\n\nOur Bison is committed to producing high-quality bison meat. Our pasture breeding program, which places bison back in their natural habitat, ensures that we produce only the best bison meat. By monitoring the bison throughout their lives, we have unparalleled control of our entire supply chain.\n\nRAISED WITHOUT THE USE OF ADDED GROWTH HORMONES\nMINIMUM HUMAN INTERACTION FOR REDUCED ANIMAL STRESS\nAGE VERIFIED AND GRADED FOR EXPORT\nELK\n\nOur elk is raised in the Canadian prairies by passionate ranchers. Our direct work with ranchers ensures constant supply and high-quality meat. For more information about our Canadian elk meat, download our brochure.\n\nCONSISTENT SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS AVAILABLE\nFULL TRACEABILITY, ENSURING OPTIMUM HEALTH AND MEAT QUALITY\nNATURALLY RAISED AND FREE OF GROWTH ENHANCERS\nHORSE\n\nBouvry have been providing high-quality horse meat for over 35 years. Animal welfare is our priority, and our traceability program ensures total traceability for every horse in our supply chain. It’s just part of our commitment to high-quality, safe, gourmet meat products. For more information about our Canadian horse meat, download our brochure.\n\nRAISED WITH ANIMAL WELFARE IN MIND\nTRACEABILITY\nUNDER STRICT GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND SURVEILLANCE\n\nOur meats are inspected by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and we are Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) certified.\n\nQuality runs deep at Bouvry.\nOur first butcher shop, Maison Bouvry, opened as a family business in Paris in 1887. Over 100 years later, a sense of pride and dedication to quality drives\nour entire operation.\n\nCountries We Serve\n\nThanks to our premium, tamper-proof packaging and first-rate shipping timelines, we deliver all over the world and have our own distribution company in Europe, Equus SAS. All of our meats also come with a high degree of traceability – even when our products are shipped all over the globe, they can be traced back to their origin.\n\nWe are approved and certified to export meat to:\n\nAUSTRIA\nBELGIUM\nBULGARIA\nCANADA\nCROATIA\nCZECH REPUBLIC\nDENMARK\nESTONIA\nEGYPT\nFINLAND\nFRANCE\nGERMANY\nGREECE\nHONG KONG\nHUNGARY\nIRELAND\nITALY\nJAPAN\nKAZAKHSTAN\nLATVIA\nLITHUANIA\nLUXEMBOURG\nMALTA\nMACAO\nMEXICO\nNETHERLANDS\nPHILIPPINES\nPOLAND\nPORTUGAL\nREPUBLIC OF CYPRUS\nROMANIA\nRUSSIA\nSLOVAKIA\nSLOVENIA\nSOUTH AFRICA\nSOUTH KOREA\nSPAIN\nSWEDEN\nSWITZERLAND\nUNITED STATES\nUNITED KINGDOM\nVIETNAM\n\nContact Us\nNAME*\nEMAIL**\nCOMPANY\nCOUNTRY**\n PLEASE CHECK BOX TO RECEIVE ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS FROM BOUVRY EXPORTS\nI AM A:\n RETAILER RESTAURANTEUR DISTRIBUTOR CONSUMER\nCOMMENTS\n\nRICHELIEU MEAT\nMASSUEVILLE, QC\nCANADA\n\nBEC\nFORT MACLEOD, AB\nCANADA\n\nEQUUS SAS\nPARIS, FRANCE\n \n\nPRIVACY POLICY\nJOB OPPORTUNITIES\nIT’S BUSINESS AS USUAL AT BOUVRY EXPORTS!"

Our growing line of products includes chevre cheese (mot-clé seo), goat Greek yogurt and various dips.

A skill that is still passed down from one generation to another.\n\nMeet Habib\n\nThe olive harvest is a time for celebration. Farmers spend days in fields from dawn till dusk, only breaking to drink tea or eat food as they work their magic on this sacred fruit that will bring blessings throughout the year.\n\nHarvest Season\n\nYousef has a passion for working with olives and derives great joy from just the smell of the olives and the look at the oil flowing like liquid gold throughout the process. He loves his job and finds real pleasure in sharing it with others\n\nSay Hi To Yousef\n\nGrowing, harvesting, and producing olive oil is woven into the fabric of life in Tunisia. Over 50,000 farmers work in our orchards and form a strong community centered around these olive trees\n\nCommunity Empowerment\n\nOur farmers hand-pick the olives, and CHO uses advanced mills to produce the distinct smooth taste of our extra virgin olive oil.\n\nHand-Harvest\n\nWomen account for 60% of the workforce in olive farming in Tunisia. Halima is one of those women farmers whose daily routine changes when it's harvest time and she goes to the fields by sunrise.

Year round the 'Ocean Pearl' is catching Sablefish, along with some Halibut and Rockfish. \n\nFV SCANIA QUEEN\n\nOur ‘Queen’ reels in Spring, Coho, and Pink Salmon for us. Captained each summer by our fearless leader Bob Fraumeni while he mentors future fishers.\n\nFV MALAHAT II\n\nThe Malahat isn't just the stretch of highway between Victoria and Duncan... it also is the name of a member of our fleet!  She fishes for Albacore Tuna, Halibut and Lingcod\n\nFV NORDIC SPIRIT\n\nThis 56’ member of our fleet, catches Spot Prawns, Halibut, Tuna and Sablefish. It is set up for various sustainable catch methods including, traps and long-lining\n\nFV HANNA LIO\n\nThe 'Hanna Lio' longlines for Halibut, and Sablefish but also brings in our, Rockfish, and Lingcod as some tasty bi-catch\n\nFV STAR WARS II\n\nThe Star Wars II is one of our largest ships, but it packs one of our smallest fish: herring. Beyond Herring Packing, the Star Wars II also brings in Halibut and goes on some very impressive Ghost Gear Recovery missions \n\nFV NORDIC RAND\n\nYou can find the 'Nordic Rand' reeling in Tuna, Spot Prawns, Sablefish, and Halibut.\n\nFV SALMON KING\n\nThis Tuna-catching machine finds its home south of the border as part of our US fleet.\n\nThe 'Conquest' makes up the other half of our US fleet.\n\n \n\nSHOP NOW\n          \nWHY WE ARE THE FINEST\nThe Story of This Can\nFEB 16, 2023\nThe Finest Fish and Chips\nFEB 15, 2023\nFresh is Not Always Best\nFEB 15, 2023\n RECIPES\nCONTACT US\n\nWe at Finest at Sea take great pride in the service that we provide to all of our customers.

If organic-certified or ASC-certified products are not available, our minimum sourcing standard for farmed products is GLOBAL G.A.P. For wild products, we commit to sourcing MSC-certified fish and seafood as a priority. DOM has a full-chain traceability policy in place to support our sustainable seafood commitment: tracing product scientific name, geographic origin, farmed or wild, and gear type or farming method. As of today, our seafood purchases meet 100% of this commitment.\n\nFinding greener, cleaner food sources is important to our global future. Animal farming, overpopulation, and overfishing have the greatest impacts on our planet, and making sustainable choices is an easy and powerful way to minimize these effects. New technology within the fishing industry has led to stricter guidelines and higher standards for raising fish, meaning less intrusion on the environment.\nResponsible sourcing and fishing is about supporting healthier oceans. All DOM seafood products are responsibly sourced–farmed or harvested from select locations around the world. We began our journey with Norwegian Fjord, sustainably sourced salmon from the cold waters of Norway. All DOM seafood are products you can feel good about buying and about eating. We care about our oceans and the ecosystems that need to be safeguarded. We’ve also developed a line of organic products that help to protect and preserve ecosystems. All DOM Organics products are free of any chemicals, antibiotics, or hormones, and fish are fed an organic, GMO-free diet. Making a choice to support responsible fishing is easy–you can do it every time you purchase seafood. Whether shopping for your restaurant or for your family, choose responsibly. Choose DOM.\n\nLEARN MORE\nOUR SEAFOOD\nA QUEST FOR EXCELLENCE\nDOM International is all about bringing you the world’s finest seafood. We’ve ventured around the world to find the best our oceans have to offer and, on this quest of excellence, have developed a line of distinct products. Norwegian Fjord salmon is authentically Scandinavian, raised in the deep, glacier-fed waters of Norway–from our traditionally smoked salmon and gravad lax to our fresh salmon. DOM Organics is a clean, green choice and features certified-organic seafood, raised without the use of antibiotics, hormones, or chemicals, including Organic Shrimp, Organic Mussels, and Organic Salmon. DOM Reserve puts the restaurant in your kitchen–chef-inspired, pre-seasoned cedar-planked salmon, escargots, marinated salmon portions, and smoked salmon; add something special to your table with ease. DOM Specialty is quality, pre-packaged smoked salmon priced for every day–great for busy, on-the-go lifestyles. From poaching and steaming to grilling and roasting, preparing seafood doesn’t have to be difficult. We’ve provided a list of Cooking Tips & Tricks with easy instructions for cooking fish like a professional. Not sure how to handle seafood? Don’t worry–we’ve provided advice on that, too! Steamed mussels, grilled shrimp skewers, roasted parmesan-crusted salmon–you can do it all with help from DOM. Planning a weekend brunch? Looking for ways to get more seafood into your family’s diet?

We are a highly accredited company with an emphasis on quality and service, on a level which sets us apart from our competitor. From the minute, you enter our facility or speak to us via telephone our commitment to excellence is clearly evident.\n\nWe are simply different, from our unrivaled service, knowledge and expertise, and overall quality, to our professional yet friendly demeanor. We are a young, energetic, and exciting company that strives to be the best at what we do; manufacture quality products.\n\nMr. Glen North founded the company in 1999 under the name Pacific Natural Products Inc. PNP has rapidly grown to become one of Canada’s largest contract manufacturers of nutritional supplements. In 2007 the company changed it’s name to PNP Pharmaceuticals Inc. to better reflect the current scope of services provided. Today PNP Pharmaceuticals manufactures Nutraceuticals and OTC products for markets worldwide.\n“Our customer service shall be fair, expedient, without prejudice, and ever present”\n\nPNP Pharmaceuticals' commitment to excellence begins with genuine dedication of each and every employee. We diligently perform our specific duties without compromise to ensure all products manufactured are of the finest quality possible.\n\nWe at PNP Pharmaceuticals are strong in our convictions to see our commitments are never compromised, for that reason we promise that ethics will always take precedent over profits.\n\n- Glen North, President & CEO\n\nOur newly constructed facility is over 78,000 square feet in size located in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. We are 15 minutes from Vancouver International Airport and only 20 minutes from downtown Vancouver.\n\nOur manufacturing facility meets or exceeds all GMP requirements and includes:\n\nNegative pressure Hepa filtered air throughout all production rooms to eliminate cross contamination.\nAll plant air is humidity monitored and controlled to eliminate mold and bacteria growth and maintain material stability\nProduction area air is supplied with 100% sterile air via UV light system.\nAll plant air is temperature controlled\nProduction area floors are chemical resistant MMA with coved corners for durability and ease of cleaning.\nWalls are non-porous fiberglass or custom paint for easy cleaning\nRefrigeration and freezing units.\n24 hour security surveillance, HD internet camera and alarm monitored\n\nOur facility was designed for function as well as employee comfort therefore extra glass was incorporated wherever possible to give the production area a staff friendly feel.\n\nPNP Pharmaceuticals has brought together a talented team of professionals that collectively bring a wealth of knowledge from their specific fields of expertise.\n\nSee our team\nServices\nCoating\nThe coating of a tablet, softgel or two piece hard gelatin capsule offers many advantages, such as a higher physiochemical stability, better compliance and increased therapeutic efficacy of the active ingredient. Our expertise in coating can offer the following possibilities for your product:\nGI targeting (gastroresistance, release in the colon)\nProtective coatings (taste and odour masking, protect against moisture)\nElegant appearance with a colour coating of choice\nOur coating system allows us to film/enteric coat tablets, softgel capsules, two piece hard gelatin capsules or two piece vegetarian capsules.  We can colour coat your product to match an existing product colour or develop a new colour to your specifications.\nEncapsulation\nWe are industry leaders in encapsulation with the ability to produce over 10 million capsules per day. We have all new high speed fully automatic as well as semi-automatic capsules fillers to do both large and small runs. Our extensive capsule filling equipment allows us to produce capsule sizes #4, #3, #2, #1, “0” and “00”. We can offer a choice of colour or have your logo printed on the capsule. Capsules are available in vegetarian, bovine gelatin or porcine gelatin, and Halal and Kosher certified if required. Two piece hard gelatin or vegetarian capsules are the preferred and most common solid dosage form in the nutraceutical industry, because they have some advantages. Two-piece capsules are preferred by consumers, get products to market faster and use less excipients.\nTableting\n\nTablets comprise the largest group of delivery systems for all prescribed and over-the-counter (OTC) medications. Reasons for the popularity of tablets include the ease of accurate dosage and the good physical/chemical stability because of low moisture content, as well as the competitive unit production costs and the easily identifiable, elegant distinctive appearance.\n\nWe have the expertise and equipment to make almost any shape and size tablet you require. Some of the most common types of tablets we manufacture are:\n\nImmediate release, coated or uncoated\nModified release, coated or uncoated\nEffervescent (dissolved/suspended in water before drinking)\nChewable (chewed before swallowing)\n\nWe can custom design tablet tooling for specific shape or size along with company logo or product name embossed into the tablet.\n\nBlister Packaging & Cartoning\n\nWe have a high speed blister packaging line that can accommodate all of your blister packaging needs. Our online printer can print your logo, company name or anything else you require on the back of each blister pack. We can produce a custom blister card to your requirements with little lead time.\n\nOur high speed cartoner is capable of erecting the carton, inserting the blister card(s) or bottle, inserting a pamphlet, printing LOT/Exp, and sealing the carton at a speed of one every second. We can assist you in design and printing of the carton or just let us do it all.\n\nBottling & Labelling\nWe have three fully automatic high speed bottling lines that can accommodate any size or shape of bottle and/or cap. Our lines include bottle descrambling, high speed counting, dessicant dispenser, cotton inserter, capper, induction sealer, neckbander and automated shrink wrapper.\nPouching & Sachet Filling – Powder, Liquid, Capsules and Tablets\nWe have the ability to produce single serving pouches or sample packs with powder or multiple capsules or tablets in large or small volume. Our pouching equipment can accommodate a minimum pouch size of 63mm x 94 mm (2.5” x 3.75”) to a maximum size of 112mm x 150mm (4.5” x 6”). Our equipment has the versatility to pouch in a variety of material including foil, paper, and poly. We can liquid fill custom shaped sachets for easy single dose applications, such as cough syrup or energy gels.\nStick Packaging\nOur high-speed stick packaging equipment can produce over 800,000 sticks per day and accurately dose both pharmaceutical and nutraceutical powders. Stick packs are ideally suited for single dose applications from 0.5 grams to 10 grams, depending on material bulk density.\nFormulation\n\nTo consistently produce a product of high standard you must first begin with a Master Formula. A quality Master Formula may take extensive R&D to ensure the formulation meets all specifications. A correctly formulated Master formula ensures that the product: meets all product specifications (dosage, disintegration, stability, etc.), can run successfully on specific equipment, has an elegant appearance, can be readily duplicated.\n\nPNP Pharmaceuticals has the expertise to formulate most any dry dosage form, such as, capsule, tablet, and powder.  From the simple to the most complex formulations our experienced formulators can confidently fulfill your requirements.\n\nBlending\n\nThe blending stage is a critical area of production, for without a homogenous blend the finished product will not meet specifications. PNP Pharmaceuticals employees several blenders that are specifically designed and validated for different applications.  Our blending equipment includes:\n\nlarge ribbon blenders - with a maximum blend capacity of 1500kg (3300lb).\nlarge V-blenders - with a maximum blend capacity of 500kg (1100lb).\nsmall offset twin cone blender - with a maximum blend capacity of 100kg (220lb).\n\nAll blenders are custom manufactured from high quality stainless steel and meet or exceed all GMP requirements.\n\nCoating\nThe coating of a tablet, softgel or two piece hard gelatin capsule offers many advantages, such as a higher physiochemical stability, better compliance and increased therapeutic efficacy of the active ingredient. Our expertise in coating can offer the following possibilities for your product:\nGI targeting (gastroresistance, release in the colon)\nProtective coatings (taste and odour masking, protect against moisture)\nElegant appearance with a colour coating of choice\nOur coating system allows us to film/enteric coat tablets, softgel capsules, two piece hard gelatin capsules or two piece vegetarian capsules.  We can colour coat your product to match an existing product colour or develop a new colour to your specifications.\nEncapsulation\nWe are industry leaders in encapsulation with the ability to produce over 10 million capsules per day. We have all new high speed fully automatic as well as semi-automatic capsules fillers to do both large and small runs. Our extensive capsule filling equipment allows us to produce capsule sizes #4, #3, #2, #1, “0” and “00”. We can offer a choice of colour or have your logo printed on the capsule. Capsules are available in vegetarian, bovine gelatin or porcine gelatin, and Halal and Kosher certified if required. Two piece hard gelatin or vegetarian capsules are the preferred and most common solid dosage form in the nutraceutical industry, because they have some advantages. Two-piece capsules are preferred by consumers, get products to market faster and use less excipients.\nPrevious\nNext\nClose\n\nEncapsulation\n\nTableting\n\nBlister Packs\n\nBottling\n\nPouching\n\nStick Packaging\n\nFormulation\n\nBlending\n\nCoating\n\nNext\nQuality Control & Compliance\n\nSpeed, efficiency and service are meaningless without the most important component of all, QUALITY. At PNP Pharmaceuticals we are always industry leaders in implementing new methods and technology to ensure quality is ever-present.\n\nAs a GMP company, ALL vendors are rigorously screened and qualified before given an approved vendor status.\nAll incoming raw material is immediately received into quarantine and immediately sampled.\nSampled raw material is sent to accredited third party laboratory and tested for identification, potency, chemical and microbial contaminants. Results are analyzed to our client’s specifications and either approved or rejected.\nApproved material is electronically released into inventory to await manufacturing.\nAs material is dispensed for manufacturing our computer system electronically monitors the material, checking for correct raw material, quantity dispensed and valid expiration. This system reduces the chance of human error.\nThroughout the manufacturing process, our QA/QC personnel performs in-process sampling and in-house testing to ensure uniformity to our specifications. In-house testing may include but not limited to disintegration, hardness, friability, and weight variation. The product in bulk form is tested by third party laboratory according to applicable specifications. If all tests meet applicable specifications, the manufactured product is released for packaging or shipment in bulk.\nDuring the packaging phase, again our QA/QC personnel perform in-process sampling and testing (such as fill accuracy, integrity of seal, label verification, and correctness of lot number and expiry date) to ensure conformity to specifications. If all specifications are met the product will undergo finished product testing before being released for shipment.\nSite Licence (Can be provided upon request)\n\nUnder the NHPD regulations set forth by Health Canada all manufacturers of natural health products must have a valid Site Licence to fabricate and/or package nutritional products. PNP Pharmaceuticals holds the honor of being one of the first manufacturers to be issued a Site Licence in Canada.\n\nEstablishment Licence (Can be provided upon request)\n\nRegulations set forth by Health Canada state all manufacturers of drug products must have a valid Establishment Licence to fabricate and/or package drug products.

We choose our chicken producers with care.\n\nRaising chicken\nThe best quality chicken comes from the finest raising method.\n\nIt is said that we are what we eat, and this is true for animals too. Our requirements cover the kind of food that chickens are fed and the overall conditions under which they are raised. We also promote animal welfare and humane care so that we may offer our customers chickens that were raised under the best conditions.\n\nTransportation and slaughtering\nBy respecting the animal, we respect the consumer.\n\nThe transportation of live chickens from the producer to the slaughterhouse is a critical step in the whole transformation process. We make sure that the chickens are transported under the best conditions. Handling and slaughtering operations are conducted in a matter to reduce stress to a minimum. Respect for the animal welfare is as much a question of ethics as it is of quality meat.\n\nOur chilling process\nBy remaining dry, the meat remains wholesome and flavourful.\n\nWith our totally unique chilling method, we have perfected a 100% air-chilling process that ensures greater food safety and superior natural flavor. Unlike other methods employed in North America, there is no added water in Giannone chicken. Our chilling process reduces the risk of contamination and conserves the meat's natural juices, preserving also its precious enzymes and proteins.\n\nVacuum-seal technology\nFor the ultimate in appearance, flavour, shelf-life and food safety\n\nTake advantage of a product that is fully vacuum-sealed over the entire surface in contact with the tray. In addition to improving presentation and optimizing the conservation of every cut, this method enhances flavour. Vacuum-sealed packaging serves to accentuate the action of the seasonings or marinade.\n\nCustom products for retailers and restaurants\nThe best chicken is good; presented your way is better.\n\nWe have innovated to the point that we had to coin the term \"value-added processing plant\" to define what we do. We are forming more and more product development partnerships in areas of cuts, recipes, packaging and shelf display. This all-inclusive approach means we can create custom, value-added products for retailers and restaurants.\n\nDiscover our custom products\n \nOur Method\nSelection\n \nBreeding\n \nTransportation and Slaughtering\n \nChilling\n \nVacuum Packaging\n \nCustom Products\n \nGiannone Poultry\nGiannone Chicken\n \nProducts and Certifications\n \nPlain Chicken\n \nSeasoned Chicken\n \nVacuum-sealed Chicken\n \nCustom Products\n \nWhy Giannone\nNew Standards\n \nTurn key products\n \nOur History\n \nOur Humane Ethics\n \nRespect for the environment\n \nContact us\nCareers\n© 2019 Volaille Giannone inc.

Our baking family, operated by the Pita Bread Factory, is proud to provide you with bread products and baked goods that can be found in your favourite stores and restaurants across the country, many in organic and gluten-free options. We invite you to learn more about who we are and what we do. \n\nOur Story\nOur History\n\nThe old saying “Mother knows best” sure came true for us! Our story began after Fady Hayek and his family moved to Vancouver from Ottawa, sold their restaurant business and were looking for a new opportunity. His mother teasingly suggested opening a bakery to sell pitas made from an old family recipe, and thank goodness 25-year-old Fady took her advice to heart. Over thirty years later the Pita Bread Factory, under the Bakestone Brothers and 24th Avenue labels, continues to thrive. Today, we are a certified organic bakery that offers a wide array of ethnic bread products and baked goods that are sold throughout Canada and parts of the United States under our own labels and the private labels of many happy retail partners.\n\nWhile our origins began in 1984 with pita hand-made in a small commercial kitchen, we now proudly offer a wide range of wholesome products from our certified and sophisticated manufacturing operation that still relies on the traditions of our artisanal roots. Even though we have grown in size, our Bakestone Brothers family continues to create the finest baked goods for your family, using timeless techniques and the legacy of the Hayek family’s commitment to fresh, wholesome products made in the spirit of Mama’s kitchen. We take our responsibility to our family and yours seriously, so you can always count on fresh and fabulous food for your table.\n\nOur Pledge to You\n\nAt Bakestone Brothers we know that while the kitchen is said to be the heart of the home, fresh bread is its soul. This is why our family is committed to providing your family with a reason to gather around the table by baking the highest quality products, created from the finest ingredients to ensure that every bite you take is delicious. Each of our mouth watering recipes is fashioned by dedicated artisans in our BRC Global Standards-certified kitchens, who have sourced the best methods from bread baking cultures around the world. As a certified organic facility, we also provide product options that are gluten-free to ensure that all of our bread-loving customers can enjoy their favourite baked goods regardless of dietary needs. Providing you with the finest flavours, textures and unparalleled quality is our promise grounded in the tradition of integrity and customer service we have taken pride in since 1984.\n\nOur People\n\nThe Bakestone Brothers’ steadfast commitment to deliver first rate breads and baked goods begins with our staff; they are the people in our kitchens and offices who we are proud to call important members of the Bakestone Brothers family. We have a dedicated team of highly trained artisans and administrative staff who continue our proud tradition of family; in fact, several members of our team have worked with us for over twenty years!\n\nOur professional Bakestone Brothers family is serious about bread and baking and we go to great lengths to provide them with the best work environment possible. We love to see our team flourish creating and delivering the mouth-watering tastes our customers love to your favourite stores and restaurants when they are fresh out of the oven. We get excited about what we do and take pride in our products, so you can be guaranteed of quality, wholesome products on your table.\n\nOur Vision, Mission and Values\n\nBakestone Brothers is a leader in providing products of exceptional quality to our customers across the world.\n\nOur mission is to manufacture and deliver high quality baked goods that exceed the expectations of our customers in terms of delivery, specification and price.

Syrup Waffles or stroopwafels have been our specialty since 1985. Now, after many years of introducing them to Canadian and American residents they are often referred to as \"Waffle Cookies\". A Syrup waffle is a cookie baked by being pressed together using an iron, sliced through the middle while they are still steaming hot and filled with a special syrup filling. Using a closely guarded recipe brought over from Holland we at Schep's Bakeries produce a syrup waffle in the same manner as those who started making them in the early 1800's. Still importing many of our specialty ingredients directly from Holland we strive to make the best possible stroopwafels and are delighted when visitors from Holland comment on the great taste of our waffle cookies.\n\nThe Schep Family\n\nContact Information\n\nSchep's Bakeries Ltd.\n813185 Baseline Road\nNorwich, ON N0J1P0\nPhone: (519) 468-3759\nFax: (519) 468-2113\n\nWatch Our Video\n\n\nView Video\n\n\n  This page was created on Tuesday, January 14, 2025 at 11:03:43 PM (EST) in 0.004188060760498 seconds for 103.110.254.19.\nCopyright© 2008 CC.

Et pourquoi est-elle moins chère que la viande biologique?\nLe bœuf naturel est élevé avec un régime composé d'herbe (pâturage) et d'une petite quantité de céréales telles que l'orge, l'avoine et le maïs. La différence de prix reflète le processus de certification des producteurs biologiques en ce qui concerne la certification et les directives de l'agence et de leurs inspecteurs.\nQuelle est la différence entre de la viande naturelle et de la viande biologique?\nLe bœuf biologique, tout comme le bœuf naturel, est élevé avec un régime fourrager. Ces animaux ruminants sont faits pour consommer des fourrages. Ils sont tous deux élevés sans aucune forme d'hormones ni d'antibiotiques. Cependant, la différence réside dans les grains qu'ils reçoivent. Les producteurs biologiques respectent des réglementations strictes pour s'assurer qu'aucun herbicide ou pesticide n'est utilisé lors de la culture de leurs cultures. Alors que le bœuf naturel est élevé sur des fourrages et des céréales qui sont cultivés de manière conventionnelle.\nQuel est la différence entre des oeufs de poules en liberté ''FREE RANGE'' et ''FREE RUN''?\nLes œufs ''Free Run'' sont produits par des poules qui courent librement dans une grange à aire ouverte qui a une variété de nids et de perchoirs. Ils ne sont pas hébergés dans des cages. Les poules en liberté ''Free Range'' ont les mêmes libertés, mais elles ont en plus accès à l'extérieur. Les œufs produits par Les Fermes Valens sont 100% en liberté ''Free Range'' donc avec accès à l'extérieur.\nQue signifie un animal 100% nourri à l'herbe?\nUn animal qui est élevé et strictement\n\nnourri à l'herbe Il ne mange que de l'herbe de la naissance à la fin de sa vie. Cela inclut également la mère qui suit un régime fourrager.\n\n \n\n \n\nCONSERVATION DES ALIMENTS:\n\nLes produits Valens sont-ils frais ou congelés?\nNotre viande fraîche est mise sous scellé puis congelée. Ainsi, elle peut se conserver un an dans votre congélateur, tout en gardant ses apports nutritionnels.\nCombien de temps puis-je garder dans mon congélateur la viande emballée sous-vide?\nUne viande bien scellée et congelée peut durer jusqu'à un an dans votre congélateur sans aucun problème.\nUne fois ma viande décongelée, combien de temps puis-je la garder dans mon réfrigérateur?\nUne fois que vous avez décongelé la viande de votre choix, il est préférable de la consommer dans les 3 à 5 jours.\n\n \n\nPour toute question sur la LIVRAISON, veuillez vous référer à notre page > LIVRAISON DE VIANDE À DOMICILE <\n\n \n\nRETOUR ET REMBOURSEMENT:\n\nLes crédits et les retours sont basés sur les produits manquants dans une commande.

Produits reçus ou descellés, etc. Pour toute préoccupation, il est préférable de nous contacter pour plus d'informations.\n\n\nUn remboursement partiel est envisageable après accord de l'équipe des ventes, pour les raisons suivantes :\n\n- Produits endommagés durant la livraison ;\n\n- Produits expirés lors de la réception de la commande ;\n\n- Produits jugés en mauvaise condition par l'équipe de vente.\n\nEn dehors de ces conditions, aucun remboursement ni retour n’est accepté.\n\n \n\nINFORMATIONS RELATIVES AU PAIEMENT\n\nChez Fermes Valens, vous avez la possibilité de payer par carte de crédit ou virement interac.

The idea, that sharing a meal with friends, a colleague or your family builds memories. Food is the connective fabric that binds us all. Think back to special events in your life. Whether it was a celebration, a holiday meal or even a lunch you shared with a long lost friend. More often than not, you remember something about the meal you had. It could be something as simple as your aunt’s mashed potatoes, your mom’s brisket, your dad’s steaks or that banquet hall’s rubber chicken.\n\nSmell, taste, colour, texture, they are all components of a memory that we can carry with us for a lifetime. It’s astounding that you can taste something and instantly pull out a memory of a time and place possibly decades past. You could say that we are memory makers or at the very least, that is what we try to be.\n\nOur single goal is to create food products that will contribute to the fond memories you make. Whether you are cooking with your family, sitting down with friends over a cheese board and a glass of wine or putting food out for a celebration, we want to be a part of your Wildly Delicious life.\n\n\nMY WILDLY DELICIOUS LIFE\n\n Find us, Follow us, Tag us! @Wildly_Delicious #mywildlydeliciouslife\n\nVIEW OUR FULL INSTAGRAM FEEDARROW\nBRANDS\nWildly Delicious\nMORE ABOUT US\nCertifications\nAbout Wildly\nFrom our home to yours!\nRegarding the Covid-19 Outbreak\nCUSTOMER SERVICE\nSearch the website\nContact Us\nDate Codes & Best Before\nShipping & Returns Policy\nSTAY CONNECTED\nFacebook Twitter Google Instagram Rss\nNEWSLETTER SIGN UP\n© WILDLY DELICIOUS PRESERVE CO.

      "textData": "Skip to content\nDomaine Pinnacle\n: Premier Ice Cider Craftsmanship and Orchard Innovations\nThe Orchard Ice Cider\nadmin1  February 24, 2021 \n\nOrchard\n\nContrary to what many people think, apple juice and apple cider are not one and the same thing. Both are prepared from squeezing juice from apples but the processes are quite different. Apple cider is primarily made from juiced apples; so, it has pulp, and high amount of minerals and vitamins compared to regular apple juice. Juices and refreshments can enhance the experience while playing betting games, keeping players refreshed and focused. Whether it’s a casual game or intense betting session, staying hydrated is key. Some platforms, like gambling site not on GamStop, offer a relaxed atmosphere, where players can enjoy their favorite games alongside a beverage. Apple cider may not be pasteurized but apple juice is always prepared through pasteurization where the juice is heated up to 190 degree Fahrenheit during processing.\n\nWhat Is Ice Cider?\n\nIce cider is prepared using apple juice that is naturally concentrated using cold. This creates high-sugar and full-bodied juicy syrup that is afterwards fermented. Ice cider, popularly called cidre de glace at its place of origin or Quebec, is essentially a cross between hard cider and ice wine. Similar to ice wine, the apples are kept on the vine for these to shrivel up during the winters. This ensures that they have sweet nectar. These super-concentrated apple juices are then fermented for that extra zing. Ice cider will typically have alcohol content ranging between 7% and 13%.\n\nIce cider is originally a product made in Quebec where it was possible to produce it because of its extremely cold temperatures. However, today you will find apple cider being made in other places too where the climate is not only conducive for growing apples but also where temperatures fall below freezing point. A cidery is the place where one can commercially prepare ice cider. It will use cryoconcentration were juices from the late-harvest apples are pressed and then allowed to freeze in winter.\n\nAll You Need To Know About Ice Cider:\n\nIce cider can be prepared using two processes, namely, cryoconcentration and cryoextraction, for concentrating natural sugars inside the apples using cold temperatures. The commonly used apples for ice cider production are Cortland, McIntosh, Spartan, and Empire. Since cryoextraction demands that apples be left on branches for much longer than when they are usually picked, orchards are growing new types of apples for producing ice cider. Cryptocurrencies empower farming by facilitating transparent payments, funding agricultural projects, and enhancing supply chain tracking via blockchain. Tokenized platforms connect farmers directly to markets, reducing intermediaries. With sustainability in focus, choosing the best crypto to buy for 2025 can support eco-friendly innovations, ensuring financial growth alongside agricultural development. Cryoconcentration, or using cold for freezing apple juices, is similar to methods used earlier by Canadians for making maple syrup. Once frozen, a part is broken off that is more concentrated.\n\nAlmost 95% of ice cider production is by harvesting apples during the autumn, keeping these fresh, and then pressing these in winter. The juice is thereafter packed inside containers left outside during the winter. In six months time, the water freezes, separating sugar. In cryoextraction, the frozen fruits are left hanging on branches until middle of winter. By this time, they get dried by the winds and cold. Then they are picked at night when temperatures are hovering between -15 degrees and -8 degrees Centigrade.\n\nIce cider has many health benefits. Apples have polyphenol and these antioxidants can prevent cancers and inflammation. They reduce risks of cardiovascular diseases and boost overall health. Phytonutrients can prevent bad cholesterol from oxidizing and triggering plaque build-up in your arteries. Apple cider may not be very rich in fiber but it has been found to alleviate constipation and irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. The drink, being unfiltered, retains pectin fiber that is responsible for good bowel movements. It is excellent for hydrating the body and prevents dehydration. When you dilute it with water, you can reduce your sugar intake.\n\n \nRecent Posts\n The Orchard Ice Cider\n\nLandshafting Theme powered by WordPress"

I can easily monitor his intake and increase or decrease the amounts he requires, depending on his conditioning required. Super easy to measure and great product for a small Equine. Radar is an 8 yr old Shetland pony. He is an all-around pony, mainly being a driving pony.\n\nClyde, Alberta\nJaycee and Murphy\n\nWe use Alfatec in the barn for ease of use, storage, and dust control. I Love your cubes! We have been using your cubes for a couple years now, it sure saves my life when I don't have to throw out a ton of hay that got mixed into the shavings! Thanks for making a Superior Product, and having awesome staff! I have picked up in bulk for other happy customers from time to time in the past few years and everyone in the office is just delightful!\n\nHolly Braddish\n\nI use your pellets everyday for my 80 goats. I love how when I open the bags they smell just like fresh cut alfalfa.\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nContact Us\nPhone: (780) 961-3958Toll Free: 1-877-ALFATEC or 1-877-253-2832\nFollow us on Social Media: \nFacebook\nYouTube\nInstagram\nCopyright Information\n©2025 Legal Alfalfa Products Ltd.

The founders and their children continue to demonstrate their environmental commitment at all stages of product and production development.\n\nSeeking new challenges?\n\nFor over 50 years, Aliments Baril has demonstrated its expertise in the areas of potato processing and fresh vegetable preparation.\n\nWould you like to work for a local company that is a leader in its sector and offers attractive working conditions in a dynamic environment?\n\nLEARN MORE\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nVacuum cooking demystified\n\nThis technique serves to maintain ingredient integrity. It also controls the cooking temperature and ensures a longer shelf life. Aliments Baril’s bagged potatoes are specially designed for vacuum cooking. The potatoes are cooked to tender perfection and retain all of their flavour. They also require very little preparation: simply reheat and serve!\n\nSQF Certification\n\n\nIn 2017, Les Aliments Baril inc. obtained the SQF certification. Therefore, we are the only company in the business of transformation of fresh potatoe in the province of Québec, that has reached this level of certification.\n\nThe SQF (Safe Quality Food) Program is an internationally-credible food safety management system. Customers can rest assured that suppliers provide food that was produced, processed, prepared and handled to the highest possible standards at all stages of the supply chain and processing steps. These standards cover food safety as well as product quality, which is a unique feature.\n\nVACUUM-STEAMED POTATOES\nSalad cubes\nBreakfast potatoes\nSmall potatoes\nFrench fries\nParisiennes\nSliced potatoes\nFRESH VEGETABLES\nPotatoes\nCarrots\nOnions\nCabbage\nCelery\nTurnips\nMixed diced vegetables\nBroccoli\nCauliflower\nFRESH POTATOES\nGrocery stores\nCompany\nCareer\nContact us\nALIMENTS BARIL\n\n297 Road 155\nSaint-Leonard-d'Aston (Quebec)\nJ0C 1M0\n\nPhone: 819 399-2277\nEmail: info@alimentsbaril.com\n\nORDER\n© Tous droits réservés - Aliments Baril - Réalisation de Signé François Roy"

There's something about the coconut oil that gives these a unique taste and a cool feeling on the tongue. The chips are very light and crispy, but not at all hard on the teeth. The garlic and herb is my least favourite of the 3 flavours, but that's not to say that I dislike it, just that I like the others more. They are really delicious! Well done to the company that makes these - you've got a special product here that screams quality.\"\n\nShop Garlic Herb\n\"Absolutely Amazing!\"\n\n\"Best tasting cracker I have ever ordered.

Once a product is approved by the Customer, a small production batch is done. Once that has been evaluated and it has been determined if any adjustments are required, full scale production commences. During this process, Global must perform many tasks which include the validation and approval of any potential new suppliers of ingredients, obtain label approval from CFIA for any meat based products, prepare product specification forms, register ECCC net and incorporate product procedures into HACCP plan.\n\nWhy Choose Us\nEasy to \nServe\nHigh Quality \nIngredients \n Fine \nDining Experience\nProducts\nTerms and Conditions \nContact\nPrivacy Policy\nCareers\n2022 Global Gourmet Foods (2020) Inc"

I like how we can search every bit of the ingredients and know they are getting adequate nutrition... Transparency is imperative. The cost is worth what they are getting in their diet.\nBREED: Boxer\nAmanda, Pet Parent\nI love the way [Open Farm does] business, where and how they source the products for their foods, and their focus on quality...I believe this is so important to my dogs' health!\nAlyson, Pet Parent\nThis is the first time I’ve tried open farm. Truly, I have never seen him more excited about a kibble. And if I leave the pantry open, you’ll find him laying down right next to the bag!!!\nBREED: Adopted super mutt\nBillie T.\nAwesome ingredients, stay fresh recyclable bag. Reasonably priced. My Shepherd always cleans his bowl. Very satisfied. 🐾\nBREED: German Shepherd\nColleen, Pet Parent\nHe LOVES the Tide &Terrain Ancient Grains Rawmix. And because he loves it so much, we have decided to make this an auto ship. It feels so good to feed him a food made with all the right ingredients.\nBREED: Miniature Aussie\nCarrie, Pet Parent\nMy sweet Aussie is a picky eater with a sensitive digestive system. I’ve tried other high-quality foods [but] Goodbowl has ample protein, and the brown rice is easy on the stomach.\nBREED: Mini Aussie\nKatherine, Pet Parent\nSwitched to a different kibble due to tummy issues, he’s loving it and his stomach is agreeing with it. Like how I can read off the ingredients and know what I’m giving my dog.\nBREED: Austrian Shepherd\nKali and Koda\nDigestion problems GONE! Luvie gobbled it up from her initial feeding onward. Her \"digestion\" problems disappeared almost instantly. HOORAY!\nBREED: Pitbull, Boxer, Lab Mix\nPaul and Luvie\nLove the new Salmon Ancient Grains Recipe for my 6 month old puppy! He never misses a meal. I’m excited to introduce him to the new puppy meal or mixers soon!\nBest Puppy Kibble Ever. She survived Parvovirus as a very small puppy. Her hair was gone from fleas and Parvovirus treatment. I started her on Open Farm & now she’s thriving!!! Almost immediate results from this...\nBREED: Corgi/German Shepherd\nMary and Mocha\nHis energy levels are great, his coat looks shiny, and I’ve noticed he’s been much more resilient to seasonal changes. These chews are a game-changer, and I couldn’t be happier with the results.\nBREED: Bichon Frise\nNicole and Oatly\nMy puppy is picky about his kibble. As soon as I handed him a few pieces he begged for more. He loves the taste (clearly!) and I like knowing he’s getting high quality nutrition from reputable sources.\nBREED: Heeler-Sheltie Mix\nLaura, Pet Parent\nMy standard poodle was a grazer and would take forever to eat. Sometimes wouldn’t even eat at all. But now he loves open farm and looks forward to eating every meal.\nBREED: Standard Poodle\nReesa, Pet Parent\nThe pickiest dog on earth likes it so far!!! She especially likes the little freeze dried nuggets! I’m so excited about this I could just hug you guys!! Thank you!\nBREED: Pittie, Chow, GSD Mix\nKimberly, Pet Parent\nMy dog has tried EVERYTHING. Name a food subscription service, he’s tried it. When I gave him his first scoop of Open Farm freeze dried food... I looked over and his bowl was EMPTY!\nBREED: Miniature Dachshund\nZainab, Pet Parent\nI swear it was the best decision I ever made. The shipping was fast, the products came in perfect condition and I would obviously order it again!\nSteve, Pet Parent\nWrigley has lost the weight he had gained from the other food he used to be on, and his coat is so much healthier! The shipping is so fast, and it comes packaged so well.\nBREED: Golden Retriever\nJoanna, Pet Parent\nThe auto ship option is great. It saves me money and is very easy to change or add an item or manage shipping schedule!\nCarrie E., Pet Parent\nHe won’t eat typical kibble and is extremely picky on wet foods. After trying Harvest Chicken Freeze Dried Raw Cat Food it’s become his favorite. Game changer for sure!\nBREED: Ragdoll\nAnne, Pet Parent\nMy kitten and cat both LOVE this stuff. I buy them both the rawmix kibble and ever since, regular kibble simply will not do... proceed with caution because your cats will become obsessed!\nBREED: Tiger Striped Tabby\nJennie, Pet Parent\nMy kittys fur is thriving... His coat is so shiny and furry, I could be hallucinating but it seems likes it's growing in thicker too. I literally can't put it on the plate without him jumping up to try to get it.\nBREED: Medium Hair\nXandria H.\nFIND US IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD\nOver 6,000 stores nationwide\nFIND A STORE\nHELP\nContact Us\nFAQ\nShipping & Returns\nSHOP\nIngredient Tracing\nStore Locator\nDog Food\nCat Food\nCOMPANY\nAbout Us\nBlog\nAmbassador Program\nCareers\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nFacebook\nInstagram\nTiktok\nUNLOCK UP TO 20% OFF YOUR FIRST ORDER\nSIGN UP\n© Copyright 2025\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nDo Not Sell My Personal Info\nAccessibility\nAODA\nOnline Consent Preferences\n|\n|\nYour Cart\nYou’re $50.00 away from free shipping!\n\nYou don’t have any items in your cart!\n\nSHOP DOG\n\nSHOP CAT\n\nSUBTOTAL\n$0.00\nSECURE CHECKOUT\n\nYour cart progress is 0%% complete.

Their vision lead them to develop never before seen methods to automate products - such as the samosa - that have been made manually for hundreds of years. With the assistance of their family and great workforce, today they have been able to build a state of the art manufacturing facility in Toronto. In March of 2011, Samosa and Sweet Factory launched their own brand, Apna Taste.

SINCE 1963.\n\t\n\t\nOUR MISSION:\n\n\n ​TO BE THE #1 CHOICE FOR EAST COAST MEAT PRODUCTS IN CANADA.\nSEE OUR FULL PRODUCT LINE\nHAPPY CUSTOMERS!\nHello!!! I just wanted to tell you how much I love your donair packages that I buy from Sobeys. I am OBSESSED. I buy them once a week at least. My boyfriend said he is so sick of donairs. I joke around and always put a Mr. Donair kit in the grocery cart when we are out shopping. I am craving one now just thinking about it. My favourite meal is a Mr. Donair kit with some provolone cheese. YUM! It is my Birthday next week and he told me he will cook me whatever I want for supper, little does he know I will be requesting a Donair Kit.  I lived in Alberta for a while a long time ago, and I am not sure if you sell your products there or not but I have sent my friends from out west photos of donairs I have made with your kit and the responses I got were things like \"that looks amazing.\" and \"drool\". Nova Scotia is the best place for donairs, and I swear yours is the best. You would make a killing for sure if you sold them there.  Thank you very much for your donairs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n​\n~ Tiffany\n1 2 3 4 5\nMy name is Daughney, I'm from New Brunswick, and I love Donairs. Growing up, Donairs were an occasional treat. They could be purchase readily in my small town of Miramichi. I now live in Hamilton, Ontario and find it hard to come by a good donair.  A few weeks ago I was killing time in a Giant Tiger when I came across your products. Skeptical about the legitimacy of donairs from a store, I hesitated to buy. My curiosity get the better of me and I bought a box. Your product was soooo good I went back and bought 4 boxes.  I have never sent a feedback on a food product before, but I couldn't help but take the time. Your donairs brought figurative tears in my eyes because for a moment I felt like a kid sitting at my kitchen table eating donairs with my family. Thank you and your team for making Donairs. It was the nostalgic experience I've been searching for. I hope to be making these donairs for my family for years to come. Keep up the great work !\n\n~Warm regards, Daughney\n1 2 3 4 5\nJust wanted to drop a line to tell you I've finally tried your bacon and I will never be going back to packaged products (other than yours) again! I've finally found you & I'm not letting go! \n1 2 3 4 5\nI just thought I would pop you off a quick e-mail to tell you that since I have found some of your products at our local Sobey’s, I buy nothing else than your products!  The Tony’s breakfast sausages are our absolute favorite and we enjoy them multiple times a month. Thank you!\n\n~ Sincerely Paula Holden\n1 2 3 4 5\nI see on the Mr Donair web site that you are the contact for quality comments. Well it was thing to be completely shocked to stumble upon Mr Donair in the freezer at our local grocer, Claytons, but it was another thing to be  sooo happy with the quality of the end result. The prep instructions were bang on and the eating experience was like being Down Home.

Transformation. Glass Packaging.\n\nGlass is a material unlike any other, capable of creating stunning, memorable experiences, and it’s the most sustainable packaging material on earth. At O-I, we have a history of transforming how the world stores food and beverages – of making glass more accessible to more customers and consumers. We reimagine how glass is made and sold by innovating production techniques, pioneering recycling and sustainable technology, and unleashing the iconic, brand-building potential of this packaging that is the kindest material for the planet and its people.\n\nRead Our Story\nOUR VISION\nShaping the Future Through Glass\n\nWe create iconic, healthy glass packaging so synonymous with brands, you recognize those brands by their packaging alone, even without a label. We innovate packaging design to enable customers to meet their own ambitions, from connecting with consumers on an emotional level to creating a more sustainable future.\n\nLearn Our Vision\nInnovation at O-I\nOUR STORY\nDriven Through Innovation\n\nInnovation and transformation are in our DNA. O-I Glass was founded more than a century ago by a man whose glass bottle making machine was called the most significant invention in glass in 2000 years. Founder Michael J. Owens’ motto was “It can be done.” And we’re doing it. We’re reimaging what glass can do, making it the world’s most versatile, charismatic and sustainable packaging material.\n\nOUR MISSION\nOur Sustainability Vision\n\nGlass is the ideal packaging material to support a low-waste, circular economy. But sustainability isn’t just about what we make – it’s also about how we make it. Sustainability is woven into everything we do, from transforming our glass-making technology and processes to our customer approach to how we engage our employees and support our communities.\n\nLearn Our Mission\n1\n2\n3\nPower of\nGlass Packaging\n\nGlass is pure, sustainable, and the kindest packaging material for the health of people and the planet. Glass has an element of magic to it. It is beautiful and iconic. It can turn into shapes. It plays with the senses. Glass is 100% recyclable and infinitely recyclable. It does not increase ocean pollution. Glass is virtually inert, which means it doesn’t interact with the foods and beverages it holds.\n\nWe love glass and we aspire to create a healthier, more sustainable, and more exciting world through glass packaging.\n\nDiscover Benefits of Glass\nGuided by Our Values\n\nAt O-I, we deeply care about our people and our culture. Guided by our values and behaviors, we’re constantly seeking to transform how we support and engage employees and the communities in which we work and live.\n\nSee Our Careers\nStay Connected\n\nFollow along on social media as we transform glass packaging and discover what’s possible with glass.\n\nWe're On Instagram\n\nDesigned to refract light like a crystal ball,...\n\nOpen\n\nYou already love cooking with EVOO.

Ilsley scholarship. \n\nWe've also recently become a committed affiliate of Dolly Parton's Imagination Library.  The Sambro Imagination Library, once sufficient funds are raised, will be mailing brand new age appropriate books out for up to 120 enrolled children in the Sambro Ketch Harbour Elementary School's catchment area.  You can help by making a charitable donation HERE which will benefit children in our own community.\n\n​\n\nIn 2018, we consolidated with the Lionheart Society, combining resources to create a strong, effective and cohesive group working towards a better community.\n\n​\n\nSACA’s long-term goal is to build and maintain a full-service community centre for the area. This will be a great space for local clubs, groups, and individuals for events such as weddings, birthday and anniversary parties, meetings, health and wellness services, support groups, classes of all types, local business expos and more, and will include the option for licensed events.\n\n​\n\nWe’re also working on building a mobility accessible fishing wharf and picnic area at Grand Lake.\n \n\nHaving our own permanent building would also mean the success of our annual Sou’Wester Days Festival would be less weather dependent, which is always a risk in Nova Scotia!\n\n​\n\nSACA sends out newsletters from time to time to let folks know about upcoming 50/50 draws and other fundraisers and upcoming events.\n\n​\n\nTo make sure you don’t miss a thing, be sure to subscribe here\n\n​\n\nDonate\n\nDonations are always appreciated. \n\nEtransfers can be sent to treasurersaca@gmail.com\n\nCheques can be made out to the Sambro Area Community Association\n\n© 2022 by Sambro Area Community Association.  To view our Privacy Policy click here"

Bulk cases are 6x5lbs. Wrapped Fruit Slices are sold in a 20lb master case.\n\n \n\nWe would be happy to discuss your private label packaging requirements. Our packaging capabilities include trays from 2.5oz (70g) to 1lb (454g) as well as tubs and gable top boxes. We use high speed packaging equipment to ensure quality packaging at a fair price.\n\nWe manufacture a large range of traditional hard candy products which are all free of major allergens and Kosher certified.\n\nABOUT US\n\nCompany History\n\nThe company dates back to 1922 when two Englishmen, George Bond and Ronald Samuel started a confectionery manufacturing company in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada called Bond and Ronald. The company manufactured sugar confectionery items and some chocolate specialties.  For many years, the firm remained small and localized to the Manitoba market.  Fruit slices were originally made from imported Agar seaweed strips which were cut, soaked overnight and then used to produce jelly in eighty pound batches. The jelly was cooked in an open gas-fired cooker and allowed to cool at ambient room temperature. The manufacturing process was slow and very labour-intensive. However, as Agar was and still remains one of the very best natural gelling agents to bring out true fruit flavour in jelly, our fruit slices always proved to be a popular item in the company's product line.\n\nIn 1957, Charles Fletcher bought the company and expanded operations. The fruit slice products were expanded, new packaging was developed and the product marketed throughout Canada. Fruit slices quickly became listed in grocery stores, department stores, and mass merchandise stores throughout Canada. In 1967, Mr. Fletcher split the growing company into two separate entities; Cavalier Candies Ltd., to concentrate on the manufacturing of sugar confectionery and Cavalier Foods Ltd. (formally Bond Foods Ltd.), to concentrate on imported confectionery products. In 1970's, flow wrapping of the fruit slices was introduced and the Pizazz \"individually wrapped bulk line was developed.\n\nIn 1986, Walter Fletcher entered the family business and expanded operations further, including the Pizazz fruit slice line. Many of the fruit slice products' labour-intensive functions were mechanized and automated. Today, Cavalier Candies Ltd. is Western Canada's largest sugar confectionery manufacturer and the largest manufacturer of Agar Fruit Slices in North America.\n\nCavalier uses the finest ingredients in the manufacture of its fruit jelly slices. Quality ingredients have been carefully selected over the years and, where possible, natural colors, flavours and other ingredients are used. Cavalier fruit jelly slices are certified Kosher throughout the year and are annually certified \"Kosher for Passover\" under the careful supervision of Rabbi Babad from Congregation Tartikov, Brooklyn, NY.\n\n \n\nWe are SQF certified, click here to view SQF certificate.

Then, as now, our cheeses are all handmade, using traditional methods and only natural ingredients. The list of what we put in our cheese is short – 100% pure goat milk, sea salt, dairy culture, and rennet. The quality of those ingredients is the key to its great taste.\n\nOur cheese is made on beautiful Salt Spring Island, and we continue to be an entirely family owned and operated company with a team dedicated to the highest quality. We pride ourselves on delivering great taste in beautiful packaging and we guarantee that every cheese receives individual care and attention.\n\nOur goal is to make simply the best tasting and looking cheese you will find, from one of the most beautiful islands in the world.\nJoin Our\nCHEESE CLUB\n\nJoin our Cheese Club and receive first access to our  carefully curated monthly Cheese Boxes.

In addition to coming from different geographies, the Kitasoo and the Xai’xais didn’t speak the same language prior to the introduction of English. The Kitasoo are the southernmost group of the Tsimshianic language family and speak Sgüüxs (a southern dialect). The Xai’xais are part of the Wakashan language family and speak Xai’xais.​\n\n \n\nToday, our community resides in Klemtu, on the east side of Swindle Island on BC’s central coast (about 500km north of Vancouver), in the heart of the Great Bear Rainforest. We have 517 band members, 319 of whom live on reserve. Our village is served by two grocery stores, a post office, cafe, community sports facility, bighouse, and a health clinic.\n\nLearn More\n\nIMAGE CREDIT: OWEN PERRY\n\nWHAT WE DO\nProtecting Our Traditional Lands and Waters\n\nWe have always had a plan for the lands and oceans and the creatures they harbour. It lives in our heritage, in our oral history and in our everyday decisions as to where we collect our food, and where we fish and harvest our trees. Since the modern world doesn’t understand our way of managing our lands and resources, we will write it down in order to explain our intentions.\n\nOur vision for our land, sea, and resources is based on the best definition of the terms sustainable. To us this means the wealth of the forests, fish, wildlife and the complexity of all life will be here forever. It also means that we will be here forever. To remain here as the Kitasoo and Xai’xais people we need to protect, manage and enhance the resources and our culture in order to ultimately protect our heritage. We also need to live in the modern world and have jobs to sustain our families and community.\n\nNo one speaks for us. Mutual respect and understanding comes from meeting with us and gaining an understanding of our people and our lands. Listen, learn, and understand, then we can work together.  \n\nIMAGE CREDIT: MOONFISH MEDIA\n\nLearn More\nQUICK LINKS\nSTORIES\nKITASOO XAI’XAIS STEWARDSHIP AUTHORITY\nPO Box 119, Klemtu, V0T 1L0\nEmail - admin@kxsa.ca\nTel - 250.839.1096\nFacebook\n \nInstagram\nKITASOO XAI’XAIS NATION COUNCIL OFFICE\nTel: 250.839.1255\nFax: 250.839.1256\nEmail: kitasooband@gmail.com\nKitasoo Band Office, PO Box 87, Klemtu, V0T 1L0\nFacebook\nKITASOO XAI’XAIS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT\nTel: 250.839.1091\nFax: 250.839.1245\nEmail: info@kitasoodevcorp.ca\nGeneral Delivery, General Delivery, Klemtu, V0T 1Z0, Canada\nFacebook\n \nYoutube\n \nInstagram\n \nTwitter\n\nSPIRIT BEAR IS AN OFFICIAL MARK OF THE KITASOO BAND.\n\nCOPYRIGHT © 2023 KITASOO XAI’XAIS NATION COUNCIL\n\nWEBSITE BY: OWEN PERRY"

Jamie was a straight talking, hard working, jack of all trades, who was a mainstay for Browns Bay Packing for decades. He never missed a day of work in 27 years, who coordinated football and hockey pools, industry slow pitch and golf tournaments and was proud of his work and his company. \n\nWe are deeply saddened and he will be truly missed! \n\nWastewater Innovation Update!\n\nWe have had a busy spring and summer processing farmed and wild salmon. Processing wild salmon for food and ceremonial purposes for 11 Vancouver island First Nations was a first for us in 33 years of business. It’s been a while since we have posted pictures of our treated effluent so here is our latest photo. \n\nFish Effluent\n\nSeptember 2022\n\nWe continue to post the results of all of our effluent sampling please see the link for 2021 results below. \n\nOur quarterly results for 2022 will be posted as soon as we receive it. There will always be concern for our discharge, which is why we remain committed that the contents of our effluent meet or exceed regulatory standards. Quarterly Reports Click Here\n\nFor the most recent work on PRV click here!\n\nWe hope the great weather last well into the fall and that you all find time to enjoy it. \n\n—Browns Bay Packing \n\n\nDoug John of Browns Bay Packing  \n\nVancouver Island Food, Social and Ceremonial Fisheries- August 2022\n\nThis past week, we helped nine different Vancouver Island first nations with offloading and processing, and distributing over 60,000 sockeye for their Food, Social and Ceremonial Fisheries (FSC). We experienced again how important that the sockeye is to First Nations. It was like the world stopped last week and the only thing that mattered was ensuring the fish arrived. We were able to experience something that is critical to our Island First Nation neighbors and friends. We experienced first-hand the cultural importance of the sockeye to First Nations.\n\n \n\nOver the past several decades the coast of B.C. has witnessed the closure and decline of many wild fish processing operations. There is critical shortage of ice and processing facilities, docks, totes, fish pumps and trucking. As an aquaculture service provider, we maintain all of this infrastructure.  After witnessing the logistical challenges of the 2014 and 2018 Fraser River sockeye run, we were ready for the chance to help. Therefore, we were able to easily assist in the food fish and the FSC. We are humbled and grateful to play a role in the 2022 fishery.\n\nSincerely\n\nBrowns Bay Packing Team\n\nYOUR TRUSTED SALMON PROCESSOR SINCE 1989\n\nWe respectfully acknowledge that we live and learn each day on the unceded traditional territories of the Laichwiltach-speaking peoples of the We Wai Kai, Wei Wai Kum, and the Kwiakah First Nations, whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day.\n\nLEARN MORE\nChoose farmed salmon!

That’s how we bring the ultimate quality and freshness to you and your family, while proudly supporting our local Canadian farmers and suppliers.\n\nFresh Pasta\n\nOur thin pasta is made with 100% durum semolina – a hard flour with a higher protein count than regular flour. It gives pasta a great flavour and bite. The second ingredient is cage-free eggs, and we’re the only Canadian pasta maker to use cage-free eggs. The final ingredient is filtered water. It’s that pure and simple!\n\nLearn More\nSavoury Sauces\n\nDuso’s creates amazing fresh sauces from our authentic Italian family recipes. Our Alfredo sauce is made using 100% true dairy – cheese is a critical ingredient here, and we carefully select only the best Canadian cheeses. Our tomato-based sauces are thick and chunky, and made from high quality, ripe tomatoes with no sugar added. And our pesto sauce is made using fresh basil – that’s why it is bright green and tastes so fresh!\n\nLearn More\nUnique Creations\n\nDuso’s is famous for our unique variety of specialty filled pasta recipes. With more than twenty varieties to choose from, you can treat yourself to extraordinarily delicious fine fare like Lemon Ricotta Mezzaluna, Braised Beef Pot Roast Ravioli, and our best selling Roasted Garlic Chicken Tortelloni!\n\nLearn More\nOrganic Selections\n\nWe want everyone to be able to experience our delicious recipes at home. That’s why we at Duso’s strive to constantly innovate new recipes for your unique tastes – and dietary restrictions. We currently offer a full range of 100% organic pastas, and we are finalizing recipes now for egg-free and fully vegan pasta offerings, including plant based Mushroom Bolognese Ravioli and Vegan Three “Cheese” Tortelloni.\n\nLearn More\nLatest Recipe Ideas\nView All Posts\nFeatured Meal Idea |\nMeal Ideas |\nRecipe Type |\nMarch 5, 2021\nPotato Leek Soup with Duso’s Roasted Garlic Chicken Tortelloni\nLearn More\nFeatured Meal Idea |\nMeal Ideas |\nMarch 5, 2021\nKale and Navy Bean Soup with Duso’s Cheese Raviolini\nThere’s nothing like a hot bowl of delicious soup to help warm up winter. \nLearn More\nFeatured Meal Idea |\nMeal Ideas |\nMarch 5, 2021\nDuso’s Chicken Mozzarella & Spinach Mezzaluna Gratin\nThis pillowy, half-moon-shaped pasta is stuffed with a decadent mix of savoury chicken and mozzarella plus vitamin-rich spinach.\nLearn More\nAbout Us\n\nOur Founder, Mauro Duso, and his family moved from Italy to Canada in the 1960s. They brought with them their authentic family recipes, founding Duso’s Fresh Pasta & Sauces and opening our iconic first retail location at Granville Island Market in Vancouver, BC.

Feed free choice or mix with rations. Formatted for 100 to 130% daily requirement of gestating beef cows at 75 to 100 grams per day consumption.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nVitamin A\n\nFresh, green grass is typically abundant with vitamin A, or at least its precursor, beta-carotene. So, livestock out on pasture in the summer months usually get plenty of vitamin A in their diets. However, in the winter months, deficiencies are more common because vitamins lose their integrity during the harvesting and storage processes.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nNew Product Line: Supremix!\n\nCeres Industries is proud to present its latest product line: Supremix! This three-step premix is meant to provide year-round vitamin and mineral nutrition, suited to the stage of production for a beef cow. Formulated with salt and molasses, these premixes are meant to be fed either free-choice or mixed into a TMR ration. The versatility of delivery makes the Supremix line easy to fit into any feeding program!

She has never reacted to the sound of packages opening, but I went to grab a treat and she came running because she knows the egg treats are in the bag. She sits and stares at the bag on the counter. These treats are just the perfect size for her.\"\nConnie Johnson\n\"Really great quality dog treats and super fresh quail eggs ! Very reasonable prices , Highly recommend Grand Valley Quail! My dogs give them two paws up\"\nCheryl Mackenzie\n\"With 3 dogs with enormous amounts of allergies, treats are tough for us....but we LOVE our @grandvalleyquailpettreats\"\n@Paige_N_Co\n\"Our pets love the little egg treats, dogs and cats included!! And I love that it’s all natural!!\"\nBeth Breadner\n\"My dogs, Benson and Wallace, and I highly recommended Grand Valley Quail dog treats. Wallace in particular is very picky when it comes to treats. Both of them come running as soon as they hear me shake the bag. The pigs ears were definitely a favourite. It’s great to find something all natural that my dogs absolutely love. My dogs and I are so happy to have found you.\"\nEVELYN LUCAS\n\"My 4.5 pound almost 7 year old maltipoo named Gucci, just got introduced to Grand Valley Quail treats. OMG, did she LOVE them. I’ve honestly never seen her be so excited for a treat. She can be picky about treats. Regular dog biscuits, she’ll smell for a while and maybe eat. She was literally trembling with excitement with the quail egg treats.\nI love how they are all natural and the quail are raised by this company as well. We know exactly what we’re putting in our fur babies tummies. I Thank you Grand Valley Quail, Gucci is looking forward to trying all your homemade products.

We have experience manufacturing pet food in the Super Premium, Mid-Range, and Economy sector.  No matter the ingredient declaration; nutrition is the focus. We are proud to say that we will try anything! This idea comes right from the President’s desk.

This allows us to have strict quality control over incoming materials and associated transport procedures.\n\nWe also have trucks dedicated to the delivery of finished pet food, and offer logistics across Ontario with our own fleet.  Our logistics team can also coordinate shipping with many reliable outside carriers.\n\nread more >>\nAbout Us!\n\nIn 1991, Spectrum Feed Services Ltd opened its doors for the first time. The partners came together with the intention of supplying a superior level of nutritional services than was currently available in the industry. Our success came by applying technical knowhow in a practical and efficient way, largely in dairy cow nutrition.\n\nAt this time, many new concepts were validated at the university level and proven to improve animal performance and reduce feed costs. To do this effectively, we required our own feed production capability, subsequently purchasing a closed feed mill in Moorefield and extensively renovating it to our needs.\n\n\n\nread more >>\nJoin Our Team!\nCLICK HERE\n\nProudly Canadian, Sourcing all Natural Ingredients Locally\n\nCOMMITTED TO IMPROVING ANIMAL HEALTH AND LONGEVITY\n\n58 McGivern St,\nMoorefield, ON, N0G 2K0\n\n519-638-3003\ninfo@spectrumfs.ca\nOur Expertise\nPet Food\nSpecialized Extrusion\nCustom Blending\nTransportation\nAccessibility Policy\nAbout\nOur Story\nCareers\nContact Us\n\n© COPYRIGHT SPECTRUM FEED SERVICES LTD.

The Juice is an industry leading buffered propionic & citric acid hay preservative with active ingredients that deliver superior results. Hay bales treated with The Juice stay fresh longer, maintain their green colour and retain valuable nutrients. Additionally, The Juice allows you to bale at a higher moisture level, effectively extending your baling window.\n\nMade in Canada by Nuhn Forage Inc., The Juice buffered propionic acid uses a unique dispersing agent to ensure even application and quality. Dispersing throughout the hay to find moisture, The Juice penetrates the entire hay stem.\n\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nBUFFERED PROPRIONIC ACID HAY PRESERVATIVE \nTHE JUICE IS AVAILABLE IN A VARIETY OF TOTE AND DRUM SIZES\nView fullsize\n2400 LB TOTE\nApplication Rate\tCoverage\n4 lbs / ton\n2 kg / tonne\t600 tons\n545 tonnes\n6 lbs / ton\n3 kg / tonne\t400 tons\n363 tonnes\n10 lbs / ton\n5 kg / tonne\t240 tons\n218 tonnes\nView fullsize\n1000 KG TOTE\nApplication Rate\tCoverage\n4 lbs / ton\n2 kg / tonne\t550 tons\n500 tonnes\n6 lbs / ton\n3 kg / tonne\t367 tons\n333 tonnes\n10 lbs / ton\n5 kg / tonne\t220 tons\n200 tonnes\nView fullsize\n450 LB DRUM\nApplication Rate\tCoverage\n4 lbs / ton\n2 kg / tonne\t112.5 tons\n102 tonnes\n6 lbs / ton\n3 kg / tonne\t75 tons\n68 tonnes\n10 lbs / ton\n5 kg / tonne\t45 tons\n41 tonnes\nView fullsize\n200 KG DRUM\nApplication Rate\tCoverage\n4 lbs / ton\n2 kg / tonne\t110 tons\n100 tonnes\n6 lbs / ton\n3 kg / tonne\t73 tons\n67 tonnes\n10 lbs / ton\n5 kg / tonne\t44 tons\n40 tonnes\nREQUEST AN ORDER\n\nBulk liquid is also available upon request. \n\nFORAGE APPLICATORS\nLIQUID APPLICATORS\nGRANULAR APPLICATORS\nAPPLICATOR ACCESSORIES\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nWHY USE THE JUICE?\nCONSISTENT GREEN BALES\n\nHay treated with The Juice will retain a nice green colour during storage, providing hay producers with a more marketable product. The Juice penetrates the entire hay stem, giving bales a consistent coverage.\n\nMOULD INHIBITOR\n\nWhen hay is not properly treated, mold will often grow in the bale. This causes the hay to become discoloured and loose it’s freshness. The Juice protects bales, keeping your hay fresh and free of harmful mould and dust.\n\nLEAF RETENTION\n\nTreating hay with The Juice will increase the feed value of your hay by retaining the nutrient filled leaves. Treated hay retains a higher percentage of dry matter per bale versus hay that is not treated with The Juice.\n\nBALE AT HIGHER HUMIDITY\n\nThe active ingredients in The Juice allow hay producers to safely bale hay at a higher moisture level without the risk of spoilage or heating. Baling at a higher moisture will extend your baling time and reduce your drying time. \n\nHAY TREATED WITH THE JUICE IS SAFE FOR ALL ANIMALS\nDAIRY COWS\n\nFeeding dairy cows a high-quality hay results in greater feed intake and, as a result, dairy cows produce more milk. Using The Juice helps bales maintain their leaves, increasing the feed value of the hay. The juice also reduces the risk of mouldy hay which can cause illness in dairy cows. Certain mould can even increase the risk of mycotic abortions.\n\nHORSES\n\nStudies have proven that treated hay is not only safe for horses, but the propionic acid in The Juice increases the energy value of the hay. Using The Juice reduces mould growth during hay's cure down period. Mould and dust decreases the feed value of hay and can cause respiratory issues in susceptible horses. \n\nLIVESTOCK\n\nFeeding beef cattle, sheep or other livestock hay that has been treated with The Juice can provide many benefits to livestock producers. Untreated hay can often grow harmful mould spores. Feeding mouldy hay to livestock can often result in illness, respiratory issues or digestive problems. \n\nTMR MIX\n\nAdded directly to your mix, The Juice is a proven mould inhibitor for total mixed rations (TMR). With a high level of active ingredients such as buffered propionic acid, citric acid and exclusive dispersing agents, The Juice reduces nutrient loss and heating while prolonging the \"bunk life\" of mixed feed.\n\nUSING THE JUICE ON STRAW BALES \nTHE JUICE STRAW PRESERVER\n\nStraw treated with The Juice puts the power back in growers hands. It gives added insurance for top quality return for your forage. At the same time, livestock owners have one less thing to stress over as their bedding material is kept at peak performance. A proper environment encourages healthy livestock and maximum potential. The Juice is the most effective acid forage preservative on the market.\n\n\n\n\nSAVE YOUR STRAW FROM MOULDS AND MYCOTOXINS\n\nSome producers add straw to their total mix ration (TMR) as an additional source of fibre. When you treat your straw with The Juice, you prevent the risk of harmful mould and bacteria spores contaminating your TMR rations. \n\nStraw is also the most common bedding material for a large variety of livestock. The risk with untreated straw is that it’s quite prone to the growth of mould spores. These spores can then be released into the air as dust, which can affect livestock and also farmers. One of the more common forms of mould  is known as Aspergillus. This particular mould can be very harmful to animals, often causing disease and respiratory issues.  \n\nThere are over 100 known strains of Aspergillus fungi. Among these, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger are the most common. All of these can cause many harmful symptoms and have been linked to a number of chronic and acute diseases in livestock. The strain Aspergillus Fumigatus is especially dangerous to horses. When inhaled into a horses lungs, the fungal spores invade the tissue in the upper air ways, causing respiratory problems. Straw that is properly treated with The Juice generates less dust and is less likely to grow harmful mould.\n\nA HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT FOR YOU AND YOUR HERD  \n\nDust can be a significant problem in straw especially when used for livestock bedding. Dust can carry mould spores and bacteria that can be harmful to animals and their owners. When applied to straw, The Juice reduces the number of airborne dust particles. Farmers Lung is a common name for the damaging respiratory effects of dust inhalation. Dust exposure can cause chronic symptoms in farmers that are similar to asthma. If dust particles are not removed removed from the lung, serious long term effects on the respiratory system can result. The Juice is a great tool to keep your work place safe for both you, and your animals.  \n\nNUHN FORAGE PRODUCTS\n\nLIQUID HAY & STRAW PRESERVATIVE\n\nGRANULAR FORAGE ADDITIVE\n\nHIGH MOISTURE CORN PRESERVATIVE\n\nFORAGE APPLICATORS\n\nNuhn Forage Inc.\nStratford, ON\n\nSite and Contents Copyright © 2025 Nuhn Forage Inc.\n\nSite by Effective Edge Communications Inc."

This is a great way to raise money for your organization.  We do have a few open dates.\n\nPlease contact Kim at 705-653-3660.\nCome and enjoy the farming atmosphere.\n\nWelcome to Hoards Station\n\nIf it seems as though farmers in Eastern Ontario are missing every Tuesday afternoon, it might just be the truth. Starting at noon, Hoards Station Community Livestock Exchange hosts a weekly Livestock auction. Every Tuesday there are a variety of livestock going through the barn including pigs, sheep, goats, dairy cattle, springers and beef cattle. It’s not uncommon to see horses, donkeys, mules and llamas as well.\n\nHoards Station also hosts the Quinte Cattlemen’s seasonal stocker sales and an annual spring equipment consignment sale. Hoards station draws large crowds for their popular Tuesday Livestock Auction, filling the parking lot to overflowing. There are buyers, sellers, staff, flea market tradesmen, spectators and don’t forget the diner where local church groups host home-cooked meals for the crowd. It’s a large-scale production with many players.\n\nMany modernizations of the popular Sale Barn, including a digital scale, RFID technology and a customized computer system enabling cheques and invoices to be printed onsite immediately after your animals are sold, have made them one of the most efficient Livestock Barns in Ontario.\n\nHoards Station Sales Barn was built in 1949 and the auction method of price discovery here hasn’t changed much since the first auction was held outside with a snow fence as the ring. Over the years a second and third ring have been added to accommodate various types of livestock. In 1997 the main cattle barn was torn down and a new addition was erected. With more pens and wider allies, the barn can sort and sell larger volumes of cattle with less stress on the cattle and the men.\n\nLargest pig ever sold here, 1075 pounds, sold for 11 cents a pound\nThe exterior of the building 1949/50 era, in the early days under the ownership of R. Williams.\n\n\nClick here for more on the history of Hoards Station Livestock Exchange\n\nHoards Station is one of the only sale barns in Eastern Ontario that has 3 rings running simultaneously. The DeNure family, a 3rd-generation family of auctioneers, welcomes you to join them every Tuesday afternoon for some good food, good times and most importantly some great auctioneering!\n\nFlea Market\nOffice Staff\nElectronic Scales\nProfessional Auctioneers\n\nWebsite by Dtour Creative"

I was happy to find it was available directly from the mill. Thank you for prompt delivery! It's still as good as I remember!\n\nAdrienne W.\n\nSuch a great grass-roots, healthy, no-nonsense product! Very grateful its still being made the way it was for so many years!\n\nTom B.\nLove this cereal!\n\nUsed to eat this cereal as a child. I enjoy it, but rotate it through my breakfast line up.\n\nDeborah H.\nExceptional\n\nThese shortbread cookies are wonderful . I have never made a cookie mix that compares to my shortbreads . What a game changer. I tried them too late for Christmas this year but they will save me a lot of time next year . I love the flavour and texture of them. You guys can do nothing wrong !\n\nWendy G.\nDelicious\n\nWhat can I say . The Arva mixes are so good , The sprouted mixes are my favourite. This banana bread mix is very very good . I’m waiting for the sprouted pumpkin muffin mix to come in stock\n\nWendy G.\n\nGreat service from Arva! I grew up on Red River cereal and am so pleased to introduce a younger generation to this delicious and healthy breakfast. 😋\n\nLynn M.\nCereal My Mother Served Me\n\nAlthough Red River Cereal is too coarse to serve by itself, and oatmeal too bland, combining both in a hot breakfast bowl is exceptional. It is great source of roughage (fibre) and has been a staple breakfast for many, many years.\nI am very pleased that Arva has picked up the recipe, trademark and original packaging from the original supplier.\nLong life, good fortune, many customers!\n\nThomas S.\n\nIt’s a great cereal— but please try to have distribution in supermarkets in Montreal!!\nThe cost otherwise is too high because of the cost of delivery.\n\nRochelle T.C.\nRevised comment\n\nOops! Muffins were plain not plan. I would add some raisins next time.\n\nKaren C.\nI'm so happy they brought Red River back\n\nThey are quick to deliver too, I was running low through Xmas and I still got my Red River in good timing!\n\nCharlene H.\nBeer Bread\n\nExcellent product as are all the offerings from Bread is easy to make and excellent with soups and chili..\n\nGeorge W.\neverything came quickly and well packaged\n\nordered a variety of products and everything came without issue\nshipping is reasonable at $10\ngood variety of products\n\nLydia\n \nWhat customers think about the store\n\nArva Flour Mill offers high-quality, locally-sourced flour products that resonate with customers due to their exceptional taste and nutritional value.

The first time we have ever had a dog that wouldn’t eat what was offered. For 10 months, we tried different foods, different toppers, even different games. We finally decided to give raw a try. We were recommended Bold by Nature Mega Chicken formula. To be honest I was a skeptic. Not only was I not expecting him to eat but I also wasn’t expecting him to eat out of the bowl without assistance. To my surprise he dove right in and finish the whole bowl. I’m not going to lie, tears were shed. Bold by Nature saved us.”\n\n– Christina P (owner) & Westley\n\nBold by Nature has changed our lives completely.\n\n“Getting Hunter to eat turned into a huge struggle around his first birthday. In the eight months that followed we tried countless high quality kibbles, and without fail after a few days he would refuse.\nA friend and our vet recommended we try a few Bold by Nature Turkey patties to see if this was something he would eat. That was it, we had found a food he would get excited for. We started adding in Pork and Duck into our routine.\nHunter has been raw fed for 3 years now and he is thriving, he has gotten a perfect bill of health from the vet who is much happier with his teeth, muscle tone and size on this diet. We constantly get complements on his hair and how soft and shiny it is.”\n\n— Krista (owner) & Hunter\n\n“Before feeding Charlie Bold by Nature, she struggled with digestive issues. We finally made the switch to raw feeding and changes [in] Charlie’s overall health have been amazing. She is leaner, stronger and happier. The yeast in her paws is non-existent and her teeth have never been whiter!\n\nShe would leave kibble in her bowl for days at times, the minute she gets her Bold by Nature patty she gobbles it down instantly! It’s been a life changing experience for her and I and I’ll never look back!”\n\n— Alyssa\n\nBetter, Bolder.\n\n“My cat was a rescue and, at one year old, had never had a solid bowel movement. The vets tried him on all sorts of hypoallergenic dry foods and wet foods, but this little guy was getting really sick from malnourishment. Then I found … Bold by Nature Cat and by day two his diarrhea was gone. Over time, my little guy is going to get better and better, and I won’t even need the vet except for annual shots! Bold by Nature changed Fox’s life, literally!”\n\n– Fox\n\n“Our dogs love Bold by Nature. We love that it is a convenient fresh food option shiny coats, bright eyes and endless energy for hiking.”\n\n– Kirstie (owner), Jackson & Memphis\n\nFrom Blah to Licked Bowl!\n\n“We got Westley in October.

Dès l’enfance, j’ai développé un goût pour l’agriculture et les affaires, en travaillant sur la ferme, mais également en faisant l’élevage de lapins, de chiens de traineaux et de veaux de grain.\n\nEn 1995, je suis déménagé à Alma pour étudier en Gestion et exploitation d’entreprise agricole, domaine dans lequel j’ai obtenu un diplôme. À partir de 1998, j’ai travaillé pour la Meunerie d’Hébertville. En 2004, comme mes patrons désiraient transférer l’entreprise, je me suis joint à Michel Bouchard pour faire l’acquisition de la concession et créer Agri-Solutions Inc.\n\nEn 2014, la passion pour la terre m’a poussé à acheter les 200 acres de terre de mon père et à louer 22 acres de bleuetière à mon beau-père. Finalement, en 2018, afin de poursuivre la croissance de l’entreprise et mon désir de pouvoir fournir aux gens une gamme complète d’aliments pour les animaux, du plus petit au plus gros, COMPAGNON a été créé. »\n\nMICHEL BOUCHARD\ncopropriétaire\n\n« Étant en affaires dans le domaine animalier depuis 1986, c’est en 2004 que nous avons décidé, mon associé et moi, d’unir nos forces et de fonder Agri-Solutions en devenant concessionnaires Purina pour le Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. Notre objectif étant d’offrir une alimentation animale de haute qualité jumelée à un service-conseil exceptionnel. Notre boutique Compagnon offre un vaste inventaire de produits et accessoires pour tous les animaux, petits comme les grands, dans un environnement accueillant et chaleureux. »\n\nANNIE BOIVIN\nreprésentante équin\n\n« Dès mon plus jeune âge, ma vie fut remplie de l’amour que m’apportent les animaux. J’ai étudié au Cégep de Saint-Félicien en Techniques du milieu naturel, dans la spécialisation en Santé animale. Une formation parfaite pour une passionnée des animaux et de la nature. J’ai ensuite suivi mon parcours en travaillant dans des cliniques vétérinaires, animaleries et refuges pour animaux, ou j’ai appris à conseiller et à écouter les clients.\n\nJ’ai ensuite complété un cours en nutrition équine à l’UQAC. Depuis maintenant plus de 20 ans dans le domaine animalier et 10 ans en nutrition équine, mon objectif est toujours de vous partager l’information et vous conseiller au meilleur de mes connaissances. Chiens, chats, poissons, chevaux, poules et bien d’autres, font tous partie de ma vie. Grâce à mon métier, je peux les côtoyer tous les jours, ce qui rend très agréable mon environnement de travail ».\n\nLAURIE-ANNE BELL TREMBLAY\nreprésentante agricole\n\n« Étant née sur la ferme familiale et passionnée d’agriculture depuis mon plus jeune âge, je savais depuis longtemps que je voulais faire de cette passion un mode de vie. Suite à mes études secondaires, j’ai décidé d’aller étudier à l’ITA de Saint-Hyacinthe pour obtenir mon diplôme en Gestion et Technologie d’Entreprise Agricole. Ces études m’ont permis de découvrir de nouveaux horizons, dont le métier de conseillère en production animale et végétale, en allant faire un stage d’été chez Agri-solutions. J’ai eu la chance de travailler avec une équipe hors pair et une entreprise formidable qui offre des produits de qualité et qui a à cœur la réussite des producteurs agricoles. J’ai eu la piqûre pour ce métier !\n\nC’est le meilleur des deux mondes pour moi. J’ai l’opportunité de travailler en agriculture, non seulement sur une ferme, mais sur toutes les fermes présentent sur mon territoire. Wow ! Je peux ajouter mon grain de sel à chacune d’entre elles et grandir avec elles au fil du temps. Je n’ai pas hésité lorsque Daniel Hêtu m’a offert un poste à temps plein en tant que conseillère en production laitière et végétale chez Agri-Solutions. J’adore travailler avec les producteurs pour les aider à faire croître leur entreprise. Mon objectif premier est de fournir le matériel nécessaire pour optimiser la rentabilité de leur compagnie en travaillant avec mon équipe solide et mes outils à la fine pointe de la technologie. Ma passion pour l’agriculture ne cesse de grandir chaque jour !\n\nAu plaisir de travailler ensemble ! »\n\nKARINE LANTAGNE\ndirectrice des opérations\n\n« Suite à mon retour en région, en 2018, Daniel m’a approché avec un beau projet ; ouvrir un magasin de nourriture et d’accessoires pour animaux. J’ai sauté sur l’opportunité de vivre une nouvelle aventure ainsi que de changer de branche pour partir du domaine de la construction et me recycler dans le domaine animalier. C’est là qu’est née notre boutique Compagnon. Mon sens du leadership, de l’organisation, mon expérience d’analyste et de gestion des achats m’ont permis de créer, avec l’aide d’une formidable équipe, une boutique qui donne un service de qualité. Je suis très fière de notre accomplissement. »\n\nSTÉPHANIE BOUCHARD\ngérante\n\nPassionné du domaine animalier, avec une soif d’apprendre, me joindre à l’équipe d’Agri-Solutions|Compagnon était pour moi un choix naturel. Je suis heureuse de vous partager mes connaissances, vous conseiller et vous offrir un bon service client.\n\nMÉGAN HUDON\nconseillère service-client\n\nÉtant reconnue depuis ma tendre enfance pour mon amour inconditionnel des animaux, je ne pouvais imaginer mon emploi-étudiant ailleurs qu’au sein de la merveilleuse équipe Agri-Solutions|Compagnon.

See for yourself, “The Animal Phenomenon”.\n\nProven Results\nTestimonials\n“\nI purchased the Galozyme Equine Sport about a month ago and I'm very happy with the results so far. My ulcer prone TB is super shiny, happier in his disposition and absolutely LOVES the taste of the product. I add a scoop to his dry feed and he licks the bowl clean 🙂\n\nI was previously using a different pre/probiotic and the results just can't compare to Galozyme. His gut is obviously feeling better, he has more energy to work and his topline looks amazing.\n\nThank you so much for not only a great product but for answering all my questions before I purchased. You have a new customer for life 🙂\n\nCHRISTINE CHUDY AND VINCENT\nChudy.org\n“\nHi there,\n\nI bought your canine product on the first day of the Royal Manitoba Winter Fair in Brandon and must say that in the short time it has been since then, my 3 dogs have definitely been affected positively by your product. No more loose stools in any of them and no tear stains on my cocker spaniel! And the bladder infection that my chocolate lab puppy had is now gone with the help of both your product and some other medications. THANK YOU!!!!! I will definitely be re-ordering your product and my husband is still thinking about using it for some of our show cattle.\n\nThanks again for coming out to Brandon and answering our questions about the product. I am really happy with my choice to put my dogs on Galozyme® Canine.\n\nTERESA BIRMINGHAM\n“\nSeveral months ago, we boarded a Thoroughbred gelding that was a nervous rack of skin and bones when we received him. We were told that the horse was a finicky eater and the owner couldn't keep weight on him. Over the course of the next 6 months, we tried an endless variety of different corn and grain rations and supplements on the horse. The horse did not pick up any condition over that timeframe, and in fact a veterinarian suggested that the horse be destroyed.\n\nThen, we were introduced to Galozyme® Feed Supplement for Equine and decided to try if as a last ditch effort. We were told that it was not an overnight fix and it might take a while before we saw any results. It was recommended that we give the horse 2 tablespoons of product per day in his regular oat ration. By the end of week 1, we noticed that the horse was finishing his grain ration for the first time since we'd had him. Mid way through week 2, we noticed that the horse was beginning to look a lot brighter, was moving more freely in his stall, and his coat was starting to pick up a shine. By the beginning of week 3, something miraculous happened! When his handler opened the door of the box stall to feed him, the horse pushed the handler over, escaped out the open barn door, and went for a canter in our hay field. It was truly a shock and a wonderful surprise! Thereafter, the horse rapidly picked up condition, became less nervous, and even his coat grew in a shinier and thicker . . . in fact, he went home a few months later and looked like a brand new horse! Thank you, Techna Vet for saving a horse and teaching some old owners some new tricks. I would strongly recommend Techna Vet's product to any livestock or pet owners! (p.s. - and presently our nursing mares and foals are excelling on your product! We are lifelong customers!)\n\nSincerely,\n\nDONNA VALEN, T.AG.\nField Services Manager\n“\nI have been using the Galozyme® Bovine product for 3 years now at Rainyridge Holsteins and now on our new farm Optimal Dairy. This product really is like none of its predecessors or competitors. We have used probiotic products before and none have satisfied us the way Galozyme® Bovine does. It has been a remarkable tool to use as a top dress in the ration for our donor animals we do embryo transfer on. It has consistently increased the number of embryos produced and especially aided by improving the quality of these embryos. Just recently we flushed three virgin heifers and averaged 22 embryos; well above the national average 0f 6. Perhaps the best use of this product has been in making ration changes in our dairy herd. One bag for 2-3 days during this key transition period has kept our milking cows on track with no production loss.

To this end, we provide a natural, clinically proven and highly effective nutritional supplement that can improve patient’s quality of life. For ease and convenience, we make our dietary supplement available in both granulate and film-coated tablets.\n\n\n\nWhat is AVEMAR™?\n\nAvemar™is an effective dietary supplement for patients with cancer and auto-immune deficiencies. Our product has been successfully tested through rigorous clinical studies. We are proud to offer patients an all-natural supplement to support their ongoing treatments. Medical experts recommend Avemar™ as a useful complement to the diets of patients undergoing various forms of cancer therapy and immunotherapy treatment.\n\nScientific studies have proven that Avemar™, when taken in conjunction with conventional cancer treatments, – radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy – can improve the efficacy of these treaments. Routine intake of Avemar™ has been shown to have long-lasting positive impacts on quality of life for oncological patients.\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\nHow Does It Work?\n\nSupports cell metabolic regulation\n\nReduces the Warburg Effect by regulating glucose metabolism at the cellular level.\n\nIncreases the immune system’s proficiency in identifying harmful cells for destruction.\n\nImproves the immune system’s ability to find “foreign” and/or “unfriendly” cells.\n\nThese “foreign” invaders hide from the immune system’s Natural Killer (NK) cells utilizing a surface molecule called MHC-I.\n\nMHC-I effectively shields foreign, harmful cells from NK cells by sending false, “friendly” messages.\n\nAvemar™Pulvis serves to suppress MHC-I’s ability to shield foreign cells from detection, thereby increasing NK cell targeting and improving immune system purging.\n\nPromotes immune system modulation.\n\nEncourages physiological cellular and humoural (Th1/Th2) immune balance.\n\nImproves T-cell response to antigen presentation.\nRegulates and modulates the immune system’s white blood cells for peak performance, including T cells, B cells, NK cells, and macrophages.\nEnhances B-cell activation and production of appropriate antibodies.\nIncreases macrophage function\nAVEMAR™ NORTH AMERICA\nAvemar™ is an effective dietary supplement for human and animal patients battling cancer and autoimmune deficiencies. It is an all-natural, clinically proven, original product that can positively impact a patient’s quality of life.

What makes A & D Bird Seed so special is that our mixes are thoroughly cleaned before packaging. This insures there are no unwanted dirt, dust, and seed hulls. The entire process is supervised and handled by one of the birding technicians in the Wyant family. All of us here at A & D Bird Seed take pride in our products.\n\nStarted in 1992, to complement the Wyant Family's farming business. The bird seed business started to grow out of the nest so a small retail store was built. In 1997 Allen and Dwayne started to create their own line of bird feeders and houses. As of today we have made 27 different custom bird mixes for ourselves in our retail store and our wholesalers.\n\nA & D Bird Seed is your source for your seeds, seed mixes, feeders and bird houses.\n\nCall, email or visit us for products and pricing next time you need bird seed.\n\nCheck out some of these birds you might find around your area.

You can observe how our wild bird seed (wild birdfeed) mixes are processed, have a friendly chat and take some of our products home with you for your feathered friends.\n\n      Six generations have been farming at this location since 1874, beginning with mixed farming, bee keeping and potato, millet and pedigreed seed production.

Chaque article est conforme à nos normes de qualité rigoureuses, garantissant ce qu’il y a de mieux pour nos amis à poils, à plumes ou à écailles.\n\nCependant, notre mission va bien au-delà de la simple offre de produits. Nous comprenons que le bien-être d’un animal de compagnie ne se résume pas à des biens matériels. C’est pourquoi nous proposons une multitude de ressources éducatives, des FAQ en ligne aux articles d’experts, en passant par les conseils dispensés en magasin par un personnel bien informé. Notre équipe d’employés dévoués offre des conseils, une orientation et un soutien sur toutes les facettes des soins aux animaux, de la nutrition et du dressage à la santé et au comportement.\n\nLes franchises locales de Pitou Minou & Compagnons sont plus qu’une boutique de quartier…\n\nElles sont un centre d’engagement communautaire.

Vous pouvez être assuré que peu importe le produit alimentaire que vous trouverez chez Pitou Minou & Compagnons, celui-ci contiendra seulement des aliments sains et naturels. Pour nous, la qualité de la nourriture pour animaux est la priorité.\n\nAxé sur les\ningrédients\n\nNous nous faisons un point d’honneur de choisir chacun des produits que nous vendons pour ses ingrédients et non pour sa marque. Nous évitons les marques populaires qu’on retrouve à l’épicerie car elles comportent des ingrédients pouvant nuire au bien-être des animaux. De plus, la majorité des produits vendus dans les succursales Pitou Minou & Compagnons sont fabriqués au Canada afin de nous assurer d’une qualité de produit supérieure et fiable.\n\nExpertise\nen nutrition\n\nLa nutrition joue un très grand rôle au niveau de la santé et du bien-être des animaux. Tous nos employés suivent une formation pour devenir des experts en nutrition animale. Tout comme chez l’humain, les animaux peuvent avoir certaines conditions ou maladies nécessitant une attention particulière. Notre équipe d’experts en nutrition animale pourra vous guider vers le produit qui conviendra le mieux à votre animal selon ses besoins spécifiques.\n\nMission\nqualité\n\nNotre mission est de promouvoir des produits alimentaires sains et naturels pour les animaux de compagnie, et ce, à travers tout le Québec. Nous souhaitons que chaque propriétaire d’animaux puisse se procurer de la nourriture pour animaux de qualité, et dont les ingrédients sont bénéfiques pour leur chat ou leur chien. C’est pourquoi nous vendons, à travers le Québec, des produits rattachés à la bannière Global Pet Foods.\n\nFormules médicales\n\nLes formules médicales pour animaux de compagnie sont des produits formulés pour répondre à des besoins spécifiques en matière de régime alimentaire ou de santé des animaux de compagnie.\n\nFORMULES MÉDICALES POUR CHIENS\nFORMULES MÉDICALES POUR CHATS\nVous souhaitez acquérir une franchise et fonder votre propre entreprise?\n\nLe succès de nos franchisés est indéniable : nous misons sur l’accompagnement personnalisé, la formation et la force de notre réseau pour faciliter leur rentabilité.
