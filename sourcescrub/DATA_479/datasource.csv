Sitar spices and Tea,Sitar spices and Tea,2016,,Kelowna,BC,,CA,,sitarspicetea.com,"At Sitar Spice and Tea we refuse to compromise on the quality and authenticity of our products, even if that means less profit. It seems like everybody is offering the highest quality, most fresh, and most pure product. Just what does any of that really mean? For us the commitment to quality starts from the very beginning. We only buy spices harvested during their peak season. Whenever possible, we choose organic sources. We keep our packaging simple, practical and user friendly. Our organic spice suppliers have won many awards both in India and in Europe. They believe in giving the farmer’s their fair share, as do we. This does not mean we compromise on quality. Organic or good quality doesn’t necessarily mean high prices. We also do believe everybody should be able to afford good quality products. Uncompromising freshness might be the single most important step to ensuring that we deliver the best product, but, being a small, family run business, the rest of the process really is a labor of love. Our spice mixes are always made in small batches. Each spice is roasted individually to bring out their best flavour. This is a time consuming process, but it is worth it. Most of our spice mixes are salt free, and we never add fillers. You might be accustomed to the widely available curry mixes sold in most stores, which contain too much of the relatively cheaper ingredients like coriander and garlic powder, but we think you’ll be in for quite a surprise when you try our authentic spice blends. For starters, be sure try my mother’s unique and, in her own little corner of India, the famous Garam Masala.","organic spices, spice mixes, teas, condiments",https://www.linkedin.com/company/sitar-spices-and-tea,1,1-10	,Production,,0,0,0,0,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,2900000,11600000,,,0,,,,"Food Production, Food & Beverages","F&B Production - US and Canada, KW Filters",https://www.sourcescrub.com/company/DMVE06KD

We import the finest quality Arabica coffee from our own coffee farm and several others, located in the verdant mountains of Colombia. We are proud to offer a full line of specialty roasted coffees for a coffee experience that is unsurpassed. Our family coffee farm is perched high in the Antioquia mountains between the elevations of 5,500 and 6,500 feet, offering an ideal location for coffee growing in the region’s rich volcanic soil. Caferros’ coffee is 100 percent naturally grown and the beans are picked by hand for optimal quality control. We take the time to make our coffee the best it can possibly be at every step in the process. All of our company operations are guided by our family values. One of our guiding principles is to provide coffee that is natural, wholesome and produced with care. We strive to provide a great coffee experience to people who care about the quality of the products they are providing for their families and themselves. As we expand our distribution, it’s essential we retain the personal touch that is fundamental to the Caferros brand. We are involved at every step of the coffee production, from overseeing the hand-picking each coffee bean at the peak of ripeness, and engaging a proprietary milling process that is superior to other milling methods, to hand-roasting our coffee in small batches. Even our approach to natural pest control makes a difference: we plant toga trees on our coffee farm to attract birds that eat harmful insects.

It didn’t take long for us to realize that people gathered, shared experiences and were brought together over cups of coffee. That there was a culture there rooted in community, education and experience. The culture behind this takes an inside look to the consideration that goes into handling, preparation and sourcing of coffee and that behind the end result was a skillfully crafted process. From machinery to sourcing, there was a lot that went behind manufacturing coffee. And so Timbertrain was born. With the desire to turn this fervent passion into a reality, Timbertrain opened up its first location in Gastown, Vancouver. Since then, the Timbertrain team has become committed to researching, finding and sourcing from quality farms around the world. Once the beans have been carefully selected for their grade and high farming ethos, they are shipped to Vancouver and expertly roasted in-house at our Depot location. Sustainability is our priority.

Pre-8/8: In compliance with FDA guidelines, all PRISM flavors were commercially marketed prior to the 8/8/16 deadline. PMTA: We are putting our entire assortment through the PMTA process, and as of 9/10/2020, the first of our multiple submissions has already already been accepted by the FDA and are now moving to the filing stage of the PMTA process! This means our flavors will be able to stay on your shelves after September 9th, 2020. Proven Success: Our top five most popular flavors sold over 400,000 bottles in 2019 alone. The numbers speak for themselves; your customers are going to love these flavors! Quality: All PRISM e-liquids are manufactured in an ISO Class 6 clean room, and certified lab tested with published results for every batch produced. For extra peace of mind, customers can easily access these results by simply scanning the QR code located on every bottle. Selection: With three lines and nineteen total flavors going through PMTA, PRISM will have one of the largest selections on the market after September, 2020. By providing a range of flavors (from menthols & tobaccos to fruits & bakeries), you’ll see that with PRISM, there is always something for everyone. Age Appropriate Marketing: For PRISM, protecting our nation’s youth is top priority.
