You will receive the name of a manufacturing company, along with optional supporting details. Please use your web search capabilities to find the official domain (URL) of that website.

Your task:
- You can only return two things: the official domain of the company or "No official website found".
- Make sure you do not send any other information, just the domain. I am using you in a script that expects only the domain name.
- Do **not** return search results, listings, directories, fan pages, third-party links, or sponsored content.
- The result should be the **official** website of the entity in question.
- If the company has no official website or you have any doubt, return "No official website found"

Here is the information you will use to find the official website:
Name: {name}
Address: {address}
Contacts Name: {contact_name}
Contacts Email: {contact_email}
